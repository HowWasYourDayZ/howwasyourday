        {/* What is peer counselling */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Is Peer Counselling?</h2>
          <p>Peer counselling is emotional support from someone with lived experience. A peer counsellor is not a licensed psychologist or therapist — they have not done a clinical degree, and they do not diagnose conditions or provide treatment. What they have is something different: they have personally been through a version of what you are facing, and they are screened specifically for active listening, holding space, and supportive conversation.</p>
          <p>The word &quot;counselling&quot; in peer counselling means something different from therapy. It is closer in spirit to &quot;someone you can talk to who has been there&quot; than to the clinical process of a professional consultation.</p>

          <h3>Peer Counsellors vs Licensed Therapists</h3>
          <p>A licensed therapist or counsellor in India has a formal degree — typically a Masters in Clinical Psychology, Counselling Psychology, or a related field. They are qualified to diagnose mental health conditions, design treatment plans, and deliver structured psychotherapy. A peer counsellor is screened for supportive conversation and active listening, but is not licensed to diagnose or treat.</p>
          <p>This distinction matters — not because peer counselling is lesser, but because the two are good at different things. For emotional overwhelm, the weight of everyday stress, relationship difficulty, family pressure, or the feeling of needing to talk to someone who gets it: peer counselling is often exactly the right tool. For a diagnosed mental health condition, clinical therapy is what is needed.</p>

          <h2>Who Is Peer Counselling For?</h2>
          <p>Peer counselling on How Was Your Day is used by people who need to talk to someone who understands — not necessarily to solve anything, but to be genuinely heard. Common situations include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Loneliness</strong> — in a new city, inside a relationship that has grown distant, or the particular loneliness of carrying things you cannot say to anyone in your life</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship stress</strong> — a marriage under strain, a difficult breakup, a friendship that has gone cold</li>
            <li><strong>Family pressure</strong> — career expectations, marriage pressure, joint family dynamics, being the one who must handle everything</li>
            <li><strong>Work burnout</strong> — the slow depletion of a job that used to feel meaningful, or the relentless pressure of one that does not stop</li>
            <li><strong>Grief</strong> — loss that does not fit neatly into a few days of leave and a return to normal</li>
            <li><strong>Student stress</strong> — entrance exam anxiety, career uncertainty, the pressure of parental expectations</li>
            <li><strong>Anxiety and low mood</strong> — not necessarily a diagnosed condition, but the ongoing weight of hard days and a mind that does not rest</li>
          </ul>
