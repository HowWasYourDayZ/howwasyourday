          <h1>Peer Support in Bengaluru — Someone to Lean On in <em>India's Tech Capital</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Bengaluru is full of driven, talented people — and quietly, a lot of them are struggling. Whether it is WFH isolation in a one-BHK, the exhaustion of startup culture, or the specific loneliness of building a life far from home, LeanOn connects you with peer listeners who truly get it.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Bengaluru's unique emotional challenges */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Bengaluru's Unique Emotional Challenges</h2>
          <p>Bengaluru has always been a city of arrivals — people come chasing opportunities, building companies, or following career paths that simply do not exist back home. What the city does not advertise is how emotionally demanding that journey can be.</p>

          <h3>WFH Isolation in a City of Strangers</h3>
          <p>Pre-pandemic, Bengaluru's office culture was a social lifeline for many — especially those who had relocated from other cities. The shift to remote and hybrid work removed that scaffolding overnight. Now, thousands of people in Koramangala, Indiranagar, HSR Layout, and Whitefield spend their days alone in flats, talking to nobody outside of work calls. The casual friction of office life — the coffee chats, the lunch runs, the post-meeting gossip — is gone, and there is nothing obvious to replace it.</p>

          <h3>Startup Burnout Is Real and Underreported</h3>
          <p>Bengaluru's startup ecosystem is one of the most celebrated in Asia — and one of the most quietly exhausting. The culture rewards hustle and penalises vulnerability. Founders and early employees often carry enormous pressure in silence: the fear of failure, investor expectations, team management stress, and the slow erosion of the original passion that started it all. Many reach out to LeanOn when they feel they cannot admit to anyone in their network how close they are to the edge.</p>

          <h3>The Relocation Experience</h3>
          <p>Bengaluru is one of India's biggest internal migration destinations. People arrive from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka's own smaller cities, and every corner of North India. The early months — navigating a new city, building social circles from scratch, adapting to a different culture and sometimes language — can be profoundly lonely. Even after years, many people describe Bengaluru as a city where you can be very busy but never fully belong.</p>

          <h3>Flat Culture vs Hometown Warmth</h3>
          <p>Back home, loneliness was buffered by family, old friends, and the organic social fabric of a familiar place. In Bengaluru, you might live with flatmates who are strangers, spend weekends running errands, and scroll through Instagram watching everyone else's highlight reel. The contrast between the life you imagined and the life you are actually living can be quietly devastating.</p>

          <h3>Career Pressure and Identity Confusion</h3>
          <p>Bengaluru attracts India's most ambitious young professionals — which means it is also a city where career anxiety runs extremely high. The constant benchmark of what others are achieving, the FOMO of not being at the right company or on the right trajectory, and the deeper question of whether you even want what you have been working so hard for — these are conversations that happen frequently on LeanOn.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How LeanOn Works in Bengaluru */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How LeanOn Works in Bengaluru</h2>
          <p>LeanOn is peer support — not therapy. That distinction matters. Our listeners are real people who have navigated the same pressures you are facing, chosen for how well they listen without judgment and support without advice-pushing.</p>

          <h3>Browse and Choose Your Listener</h3>
          <p>Start by browsing listener profiles at <a href="/browse?city=bengaluru" style={{color:'var(--teal)',fontWeight:700}}>leanon.app/browse</a>. You can filter by topic — loneliness, startup burnout, career confusion, relationships — and read about each listener's personal background before you begin. No cold starts. No awkward first minutes wondering if this person gets it.</p>

          <h3>Start in Minutes</h3>
          <p>Every session starts with a short five-minute window. Use it to gauge the connection before committing. If it feels right, continue. If not, find another listener. Sessions start at ₹160 for 15 minutes — significantly more accessible than therapy and available any time, including late nights when the weight feels heaviest.</p>

          <h3>Available When You Need It Most</h3>
          <p>Loneliness and burnout do not keep business hours. LeanOn listeners go online at different hours, often including late at night when you are staring at the ceiling in your Koramangala flat wondering if any of this is worth it.</p>

          <h3>Completely Private</h3>
          <p>Nobody in your professional network, flatmate group, or family needs to know. LeanOn is confidential by design. In a city where professional reputation feels precarious and vulnerability can feel career-limiting, that privacy matters.</p>

        {/* What Bengalureans Talk About */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Bengalureans Talk About on LeanOn</h2>
          <p>Based on the most common themes from Bengaluru users, here is what people are actually carrying:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Loneliness after relocating</strong> — "I have been here two years and I still do not have real friends."</li>
            <li><strong>Startup burnout</strong> — "I built this from nothing and now I dread Mondays. Something is very wrong."</li>
            <li><strong>Career confusion</strong> — "Everyone around me seems sure about their path. I have no idea what I actually want."</li>
            <li><strong>WFH isolation</strong> — "I can go three days without speaking to anyone in person. It is starting to affect me."</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship stress</strong> — "Long distance, different values after living in different cities, the pressure of settling down timelines."</li>
            <li><strong>The Sunday dread</strong> — "That specific Sunday evening feeling where everything feels pointless and Monday feels impossible."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>None of these are unusual. None of these are signs of weakness. They are the honest cost of living ambitiously in a demanding city — and they deserve to be spoken out loud to someone who understands.</p>
