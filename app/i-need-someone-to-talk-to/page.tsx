          <h2>You Do Not Need a Reason</h2>
          <p>Sometimes the feeling is specific — a relationship falling apart, a bad week at work, a grief you have been carrying. Sometimes it is just a heaviness you cannot name. Both are enough. You do not need to have a diagnosis, a crisis, or a well-formed problem to deserve someone to talk to.</p>
          <p>The most common thing people say before their first session is: <em>"I don&apos;t even know where to start."</em> And the most common thing they say after is: <em>"That helped more than I expected."</em> The starting is the hardest part.</p>

          <h3>What You Can Bring</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Something that has been sitting heavy and you have not said out loud yet</li>
            <li>A situation you keep turning over but have no one to process it with</li>
            <li>The feeling of not being okay without a clear reason why</li>
            <li>Loneliness, anxiety, grief, a difficult relationship, work pressure, or just a bad stretch</li>
            <li>Nothing specific — just the need to not be alone with your thoughts for 15 minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When You Prefer a Human Conversation</h2>
          <p>AI tools, journaling and self-guided exercises help some people. Others specifically want to talk with another person. How Was Your Day is designed for that preference: a one-to-one, non-clinical conversation with a screened peer listener.</p>
          <p>Listeners bring varied lived experiences and are screened for listening and boundaries. You can tell them what kind of support you are looking for, but experiences vary. How Was Your Day does not claim human conversations are better for every person or situation.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What People Come to How Was Your Day For</h2>
          <p>No two conversations are the same, but these are the most common reasons people book a session:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling lonely — in a new city, in a relationship, in their own life</li>
            <li>Anxiety and overthinking that does not switch off</li>
            <li>Grief — loss of a person, a relationship, a version of themselves</li>
            <li>Work stress, burnout, or not knowing what to do with their career</li>
            <li>A relationship that is difficult in ways they cannot say to anyone in their life</li>
            <li>The general heaviness of being a person in a demanding world</li>
            <li>Needing to vent — with no advice, no opinions, just space</li>
