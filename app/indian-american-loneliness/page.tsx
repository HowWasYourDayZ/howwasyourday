          The in-between is a real place, and it can be incredibly lonely. You grew up navigating two
          cultures simultaneously — Indian at home, American everywhere else — and somehow never feeling
          fully at home in either. That specific kind of displacement rarely gets talked about honestly.
          How Was Your Day is a space where it can be.

          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>Your American friends think your family is strict or dramatic. Your Indian relatives think you have &quot;gone Western.&quot;</li>
            <li>You code-switch constantly — different at home, different at school, different at work.</li>
            <li>The pressure to get top grades, top university, top job was never optional for you.</li>
            <li>Success has always been expected. Struggling was never allowed to show on your face.</li>
            <li>You feel guilty for not being &quot;Indian enough&quot; and guilty for not fitting in &quot;American enough.&quot;</li>
            <li>You love both cultures and sometimes feel like you cannot claim either fully.</li>

          <h2>🌉 The loneliness of being between worlds</h2>
          <p>There is a specific ache that comes from not quite belonging anywhere. You can be surrounded
            by Indian-Americans at a community event and still feel unseen. You can be the most successful
            person in the room and still feel completely hollow inside.</p>
          <p>That feeling is real and it deserves to be heard. Not explained away — heard.</p>

        <div className="card">
          <h2>Tiger parenting and the pressure to never fail</h2>
          <p>Many Indian-American families carried enormous sacrifice across an ocean. Every grade,
            every career decision, every life choice carries the weight of that sacrifice. You grew up
            knowing that failing was not just personal — it would reflect on the whole family.</p>
          <p>The result is often a person who is outwardly very high-achieving and inwardly completely
            exhausted. A How Was Your Day listener is the one place where you do not have to perform okayness.
            You can just be honest about how you actually feel.</p>

        <div className="card">
          <h2>You are allowed to be struggling</h2>
          <p>The model minority myth says Indians in America are always doing fine — succeeding in tech,
            medicine, engineering, law. It leaves no room for depression, anxiety, loneliness, or identity
            crisis. The reality is far more complicated and far more human.</p>
          <p>You do not need to be in a crisis to deserve support. You just need to be a person going
            through something hard. That is enough.</p>

            <h3>Why do Indian-Americans feel lonely even with communities around them?</h3>
            <p>Navigating two cultures means rarely feeling fully at home in either. Your American friends
              do not understand your home life and your Indian relatives do not understand your American
              experience. That in-between creates a very specific, hard-to-name loneliness.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>What is ABCD identity and why does it cause emotional pain?</h3>
            <p>ABCD — American Born Confused Desi — captures the cultural in-between: pressure to be Indian
              at home and American everywhere else. The resulting sense of not fully belonging anywhere leads
              to identity confusion, anxiety, and deep loneliness.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>Can a How Was Your Day listener help with identity-related stress?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Many How Was Your Day listeners have navigated the Indian-American experience themselves. They

          <div className="faq-item">
