        <section className="section">
          <h2>Peer support has an established meaning</h2>
          <p>Peer support generally centres on shared experience, mutual understanding, choice and a supportive relationship. SAMHSA describes peer support workers as people with relevant lived experience who help others through shared understanding, respect and mutual empowerment. NAMI likewise describes peer support workers as people with lived experience who are screened and expected to support others. These sources describe peer support broadly; they are not endorsements of How Was Your Day. How Was Your Day applies the peer-support principle to one-to-one online conversations.</p>
          <p>For independent background, see <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/recovery/peer-support-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{color:'var(--teal)',fontWeight:800}}>SAMHSA's overview of peer support workers</a> and <a href="https://www.nami.org/advocacy-at-nami/policy-positions/improving-health/workforce-peer-support-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{color:'var(--teal)',fontWeight:800}}>NAMI's description of peer support workers</a>.

        {/* What is peer support */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Is Peer Support?</h2>
          <p>Peer support is a conversation between two people — one who is going through something difficult, and one who has personally lived through something similar. The peer supporter is not a therapist, not a coach, not an algorithm. They listen, reflect, and bring the insight of lived experience — the knowledge that comes from having actually been in that fog, not from reading about it.</p>

          <h3>The &quot;Me Too&quot; Moment</h3>
          <p>There is a specific kind of relief that happens when someone says &quot;I went through something like that too&quot; — and means it. Not as a polite thing to say, but because they did. That moment of recognition changes something. The thing you have been carrying alone stops feeling like a personal failure and starts feeling like a human experience. That is the core of peer support.</p>

          <h3>Listening, Not Fixing</h3>
          <p>Most people who reach out are not looking to be fixed. They know their situation. What they need is to say the actual version of it — not the acceptable summary — to someone who will not flinch, will not try to resolve it in ten minutes, and will not change how they see you after. Peer support gives you that space.</p>

          <p>How Was Your Day is for everyday emotional weight — relationships, marriage, family pressure, loneliness, stress, wanting to vent. For some needs a specialist community is the better fit: addiction recovery (recovery fellowships), long-term support for a diagnosed mental health condition (condition-specific peer groups), LGBTQIA+-affirming support (LGBTQIA+-focused services), and anyone under 18. If you are in crisis, text SHOUT to 85258 first.</p>

          <h2>Who Uses Peer Support on How Was Your Day?</h2>
          <p>Peer support is for anyone who is carrying something they cannot easily say to the people around them. Some of the most common situations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Loneliness</strong> — in a new city, in a crowd, or inside a relationship that has grown distant</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship stress</strong> — a marriage under strain, a difficult breakup, a friendship that has gone cold</li>
            <li><strong>Family pressure</strong> — expectations around career, marriage, money; joint family friction; the weight of being the one who is supposed to handle everything</li>
            <li><strong>Work burnout</strong> — the slow hollowing out of a job that used to feel meaningful, or the acute pressure of a profession that does not stop</li>
            <li><strong>Grief</strong> — loss that does not fit neatly into a week of leave and a return to normal</li>
            <li><strong>Student pressure</strong> — entrance exam anxiety, career uncertainty, the performance of appearing fine</li>
            <li><strong>Anything you cannot say to people in your actual life</strong> — because they are too close to the problem, would worry too much, or simply would not understand</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <div className="faq-q">What is peer support?</div>
            <div className="faq-a">Peer support is a conversation with someone who has personally experienced something similar to what you are going through — not a therapist, not an AI, not a coach. It is the &quot;me too&quot; moment: the relief of being heard by someone who actually knows what it feels like from the inside, not from a textbook. Peer support focuses on being heard and understood, not on being diagnosed or fixed.</div>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <div className="faq-q">How is peer support different from therapy?</div>
            <div className="faq-a">Therapy is delivered by a licensed professional — a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counsellor — who can diagnose and treat mental health conditions. Peer support is delivered by someone with lived experience who is screened and expected to listen and support, not to diagnose or treat. Professional-care fees and wait times vary by provider and location. How Was Your Day is a different, non-clinical option for a conversation; paid prices are shown before booking and depend on the listener and mode. No appointment is needed, but availability is not guaranteed.</div>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <div className="faq-q">Is peer support effective?</div>
            <div className="faq-a">Peer support may provide shared understanding and a chance to talk with someone outside your usual circle, but individual experiences vary. It does not diagnose or treat mental-health conditions, and should not replace professional care when that is needed.</div>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <div className="faq-q">How much does peer support cost in India?</div>
            <div className="faq-a">8-minute text sessions start at £4.20 with a listener charging 40p per minute; actual price varies by listener and mode and is shown before booking. Every session is paid, from 8 minutes.</div>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <div className="faq-q">How does privacy work on How Was Your Day?</div>
            <div className="faq-a">How Was Your Day requires phone-number verification, but listeners do not see your phone number and you can choose a display name. Voice calls are not recorded. Text messages are stored and authorised administrators may review reports or safety-flagged sessions. Read the Privacy Policy for details.</div>
          </div>
          <div className="faq-item">
            <div className="faq-q">Can peer support help with anxiety or depression?</div>
            <div className="faq-a">Peer support is not a clinical treatment for anxiety or depression, and How Was Your Day does not claim otherwise. Some people find it helpful to talk with someone who has relevant lived experience; others may prefer a different kind of support. Experiences vary, and peer support should complement, not replace, professional care when that care is needed.</div>
