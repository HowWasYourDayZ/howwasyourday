          How Was Your Day is a peer support platform that connects Americans feeling lonely, overwhelmed, or
          emotionally stuck with real human listeners — people with lived experience, not AI. Not chatbots.
          Not algorithms. A real person who is actually there, online daily on Indian time across the United States.

          <h2>The American loneliness crisis is real — and AI makes it worse</h2>
          <p>
            The US Surgeon General called loneliness a public health epidemic. Remote work, post-pandemic
            disconnection, and the collapse of third places have left millions of Americans feeling
            profoundly alone — even in cities of millions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The instinct to open ChatGPT or Gemini and talk it out makes sense. It&apos;s fast, private,
            and always available. But AI generates text — it does not receive you. It cannot be moved by
            what you share. The words look like understanding, but no one is home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therapy is the right answer for many people — but therapy waitlists in the US can run
            6–12 weeks, and cost $150–$300 per session without insurance. How Was Your Day fills the gap: a real
            human, today, for $10.

          <h2>What How Was Your Day is — in plain English</h2>
          <p>
            How Was Your Day is a peer support platform. Every listener is a real human being who has applied,
            been reviewed, and chosen for how well they listen without judgment. They are not therapists. They are
            not AI. They are people — with lives, with experience of hard things — who choose to be
            present for others.
          </p>
          <p>What you get in a How Was Your Day session:</p>
          <ul className="checklist" style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>
            <li>A real person who is fully present and undivided in their attention</li>
            <li>No advice unless you ask for it — just listening and presence</li>
            <li>Complete anonymity — no name, no location, no identifying information required</li>
            <li>No appointment — US evenings fall in the Indian morning, when listeners are often online</li>
            <li>No insurance, no waitlist, no prescription — just a human who listens</li>
            <li>First 5 minutes free — no commitment, no credit card required upfront</li>
