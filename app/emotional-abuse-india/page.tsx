    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What counts as emotional abuse?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Emotional abuse includes patterns of behaviour that undermine your sense of self. This includes: consistent criticism and put-downs, silent treatment used as punishment, being told you are "too sensitive" or "imagining things", isolation from friends and family, threats, humiliation in public or private, and being made to feel responsible for the abuser\'s moods and reactions. None of this requires physical contact. It is real, it is damaging, and it is extremely common in Indian households where it is often normalised as "just how families are."' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Why is emotional abuse hard to name?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Because there is no bruise. When someone hits you, there is external evidence. When someone systematically erodes your confidence over years — through criticism, dismissal, silent treatment, and rewriting events — there is no evidence. In fact, the abuser typically offers a counter-narrative: you are too sensitive, you are overreacting, this is what you deserve. After long enough, you absorb that narrative and begin to doubt your own experience. This is by design.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Is it safe to talk about this on How Was Your Day?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Yes. Sessions are private and confidential. You do not use your full name. The listener is bound by How Was Your Day’s confidentiality rules. Nothing leaves the session. How Was Your Day is specifically designed for situations where you cannot speak freely in the rest of your life.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Should I go to therapy instead?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Therapy is valuable and we always encourage it for situations involving sustained abuse. But therapy requires time, money, and readiness. Many people are not ready to enter a clinical setting yet — they are still figuring out whether what they are experiencing is real, and whether it has a name. How Was Your Day is often the first step: a space to say what you are going through out loud, feel validated, and think about what you want to do next.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What if I am in danger?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'If you are in immediate danger or fear for your physical safety, contact the police or local emergency services first. If you are in emotional crisis, text SHOUT to 85258 or Samaritans 116 123 (free). How Was Your Day peer support is for emotional processing — it is not a crisis intervention service.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'How much does How Was Your Day cost?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Sessions start at ₹160. Your first 5-minute session is free — you pay only if you continue. No subscription, no appointment, no waiting.' },

          <h2>What Emotional Abuse Looks Like</h2>
          <p>Emotional abuse is a pattern of behaviour, not a single incident. It wears you down gradually. Some common patterns in Indian relationships:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Constant criticism — nothing you do is ever quite right, and it is delivered in a way that erodes rather than improves</li>
            <li>Silent treatment used as punishment — days of coldness to make you feel the consequences of something you did</li>
            <li>Being told you are too sensitive, imagining things, or overreacting every time you raise a concern</li>
            <li>Public humiliation disguised as a joke</li>
            <li>Isolation — subtle discouragement of your friendships or family visits</li>
            <li>Emotional volatility where you are always managing their mood to avoid an explosion</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Why It Is Hard to Name</h2>
          <p>There is no bruise. No moment you can point to and say: this is the evidence. The person doing it often presents themselves as the reasonable one, and you as the difficult, sensitive, dramatic one. After enough time, you begin to believe that version.</p>
          <p>In India, there is also a strong cultural pressure to keep family matters private and to "adjust." Women especially are expected to manage conflict through accommodation rather than direct expression. This means that naming emotional abuse as abuse &mdash; rather than as a personality clash or a phase &mdash; requires overcoming not just the abuser&apos;s narrative but the cultural one as well.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Who You Can Talk To</h2>
          <p>You cannot always talk to family &mdash; they are often inside the same system, or they will tell you to adjust. You may not be ready for a therapist. You may not want the social consequences of telling friends.</p>
          <p>A How Was Your Day listener is a screened peer with no connection to your life. They will not judge. They will not tell you to adjust. They will not tell anyone. They will just listen while you say what you have been holding.</p>
          <p>That act of being genuinely heard &mdash; by someone with no stake in the outcome &mdash; is often the beginning of clarity.</p>
