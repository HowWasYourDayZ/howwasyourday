        <h1>ChatGPT Can&apos;t Feel What You Feel. A Real Person Can.</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          AI chatbots are everywhere now. And many Indians open ChatGPT or Gemini when they feel lonely,
          overwhelmed, or need to talk. But there is a fundamental difference between getting a generated
          response and being heard by a real human being. How Was Your Day connects you with the latter.

          <h2>What AI gets wrong about Indian emotional needs</h2>
          <p>
            Indian emotional life is layered. The weight of family expectations that you both love and
            resent. The loneliness of moving to a metro where no one knows you. The anxiety of an
            arranged marriage process. Grief you are expected to get over quickly. These are not just
            &quot;emotional topics&quot; — they are specific, textured, deeply cultural experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI can describe these experiences. It cannot understand them from the inside. A real Indian
            listener on How Was Your Day has navigated these same pressures. They do not just know about them —
            they have felt them.
          </p>

          <h2>What a real Indian listener actually understands</h2>

            <li>The specific loneliness of moving alone to Mumbai, Bengaluru, or Delhi</li>
            <li>Family pressure that coexists with deep love — the Indian tension</li>
            <li>Career anxiety where your choices carry the weight of your whole family&apos;s hopes</li>
            <li>Arranged marriage dynamics — commitment to someone you are still figuring out</li>
            <li>The quiet shame of feeling lost when you &quot;should&quot; have it together</li>
            <li>Loneliness even in a joint family — surrounded by people, unseen by them</li>
            <li>The exhaustion of keeping up appearances while falling apart inside</li>

          <h2>🌙 When you open ChatGPT at 2 AM</h2>
          <p>
            You open it because you need someone. But what you get is a language model. On How Was Your Day,
            there is an actual human being — awake, present, and genuinely listening — available

          <p>
            The difference between AI and a real person is not a technical detail. It is the entire
