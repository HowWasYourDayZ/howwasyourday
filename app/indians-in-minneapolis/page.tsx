How Was Your Day listeners are based in India and understand the NRI experience, including the specific isolation of being Indian in Minnesota — the brutal winters, the predominantly white state, the smaller Indian community, and the pressure of being a high-achieving immigrant in a state that is not known for its diversity.' } },

The seasonal isolation, the lack of sunlight, the way January feels when you are from a warm country and your social world is already thin — listeners are prepared to hear all of it.' } },

          <h1>-20°C outside. <em>Just as cold inside.</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Minneapolis draws Indian professionals to its medical institutions, tech companies, and the University of Minnesota. But Minnesota winters are not just cold — they are isolating in a way that compounds everything else. When you are Indian in one of the whitest states in America, with a small community and a brutal winter, the loneliness has a specific texture. Talk to someone who gets it. First 5 minutes free.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Mayo Clinic, UMN, Medtronic: The Minnesota Indian Medical World</h2>
          <p>The Twin Cities draw Indian professionals primarily through two channels: the medical world and technology. Mayo Clinic in Rochester draws Indian physicians and researchers from across the country. The University of Minnesota has a significant Indian student and faculty community. Medtronic, UnitedHealth Group, 3M — the Minneapolis corporate world has Indian engineers and professionals distributed across the suburbs from Eden Prairie to Maple Grove to Eagan.</p>
          <p>The Indian community here is real but small by comparison to coastal cities. There are temples, cultural associations, and a functioning Indian social world. But you can spend a week in Minneapolis without seeing another Indian face in your building, your neighbourhood, or your gym. The visibility — being conspicuous as an Indian in a predominantly white state — is its own weight. The sense of being watched, of representing your entire country in every room you enter, is exhausting in a way that accumulates.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners understand this specific kind of fatigue. First 5 minutes free, from US$10.</p>

          <h2>What Minnesota Winter Does to Indian Immigrants</h2>
          <p>January in Minneapolis averages -14°C. The sun sets at 4:30pm. The cold is not just uncomfortable — it is physically constraining in a way that Indian immigrants, from a country where you can always walk outside, find profoundly isolating. The spontaneous socialising that is natural in warmer places — a walk after dinner, sitting outside, visiting a friend without a plan — doesn&rsquo;t exist for five months of the year.</p>
          <p>The Indian doctor who moved from Mumbai to work at Abbott Northwestern and spends Minnesota winter evenings indoors with Netflix and a growing anxiety about whether they made the right choice. The UMN graduate student from Chennai, here for their PhD, who has been indoors since November and whose last real conversation was with their advisor about data. The tech worker in Eden Prairie who has a comfortable suburban life and a profound sense of being somewhere they don&rsquo;t quite belong.</p>
          <p>Minneapolis (CST) is 11.5 hours behind IST. 7am Minneapolis = 6:30pm India. Before your Minnesota morning, India is awake. Talk to someone who understands. From US$10.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>The Identity Conspicuousness of Being Indian in Minnesota</h2>
          <p>Minnesota is one of the least diverse major states in America. For most Indians here, every day involves being one of the only Indian people in any given room. This has a particular effect over time. You become a spokesperson for your country in contexts where you just wanted to eat lunch. You answer questions about Indian food, Hinduism, Bollywood, and cricket that you are tired of answering. You manage other people&rsquo;s curiosity as part of your daily work.</p>
          <p>This is a real weight, and it almost never gets talked about honestly — because talking about it requires explaining the exhaustion to the very people causing it, which makes it worse. How Was Your Day exists for exactly this: a listener who already understands, who doesn&rsquo;t need to be educated, who can hold the specific complexity of Indian identity in a white Midwestern state. No appointment, no commute in the cold. First 5 minutes free.</p>
