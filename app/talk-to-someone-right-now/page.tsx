        <div className="section">
          <h2>How It Works — in Under a Minute</h2>

          <h3>1. See who is online now</h3>
          <p>Open the listener directory. Each listener shows whether they are online at this moment, so you are not guessing or waiting in a queue.</p>

          <h3>2. Pick someone whose experience matches yours</h3>
          <p>Every listener has a short profile describing what they have lived through — anxiety, a breakup, burnout, loneliness, family pressure. Choose whoever feels closest to where you are tonight.</p>

          <h3>3. Start talking — no appointment</h3>
          <p>No card, no payment details, nothing to set up in advance. You talk. If it helps, you continue. If it does not, you stop and try someone else.</p>

          <h3>4. Text or voice, entirely your choice</h3>
          <p>Some people need to hear a voice. Others can only manage typing. Both work here, and you can switch if typing suddenly feels easier than speaking.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Expectations */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>What This Is (and Isn&apos;t)</h2>
          <p>Being clear about this matters, especially right now.</p>

          <h3>It is a real human with lived experience</h3>
          <p>Not a bot, not a script, not an AI pretending to care. Every listener is a screened peer who has been through something difficult themselves and chose to sit with other people going through it. They are not therapists and they will not diagnose you — what they offer is empathy and undivided attention.</p>

          <h3>There is no appointment and no waitlist</h3>
          <p>You do not book a slot three weeks out. You open the directory and talk to whoever is available. That is the whole process.</p>

          <h3>It is private</h3>
          <p>First name only. No photo, no full name, no phone number shared with your listener. Nothing you say reaches anyone in your life.</p>

          <h3>It is NOT a crisis service</h3>
          <p>If you are in danger, thinking about ending your life, or in a medical emergency, please stop reading and call <a href="tel:116123" style={{color:'var(--teal)',fontWeight:800}}>Samaritans 116 123</a> or <a href="sms:85258" style={{color:'var(--teal)',fontWeight:800}}>text SHOUT to 85258</a> right now. Both are free, 24/7 helplines with trained crisis counsellors. That is the right help for this moment. We will be here afterwards.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Not knowing what to say */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>It&apos;s OK If You Don&apos;t Know What to Say</h2>
          <p>Most people arrive here without a tidy explanation of what is wrong. You do not need one. You do not need to have it figured out before you are allowed to talk to someone.</p>
          <p>If you are stuck, any of these are a perfectly good opening:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&quot;I&apos;ve had a really hard day.&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;I don&apos;t know where to start.&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;I just didn&apos;t want to be alone right now.&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot;Something happened and I can&apos;t tell anyone I know.&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The listener will take it from there. They will not rush you, cross-examine you, or judge what you say. There is no minimum amount of pain required to deserve an empathetic ear — a bad day counts.</p>
          <p>You can also say nothing much at all for the first few minutes. Silence is allowed. Sometimes just knowing another person is present on the other side is enough to loosen the knot in your chest.</p>
