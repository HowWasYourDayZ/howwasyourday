        <div className="section">
          <h2>Understanding Loneliness in India</h2>
          <p>Loneliness is one of the most painful and least-talked-about experiences in India. Our culture puts a premium on community — which makes it even harder to admit that you feel profoundly disconnected, even when you are surrounded by family, colleagues, and neighbours.</p>

          <h3>The 2 AM Feeling Has a Name</h3>
          <p>It hits hardest at night — that hollow ache when everyone else seems to have someone and you are staring at your phone hoping someone will text. This is not weakness. It is a deeply human response to unmet connection needs. And it is far more common than social media makes it seem.</p>

          <h3>WFH Loneliness Is Real</h3>
          <p>Since the shift to remote work, millions of young Indians have lost the casual office interactions that served as invisible social scaffolding — the coffee conversations, the lunch runs, the shoulder taps. Working from home in a one-BHK in Bangalore or Gurgaon can be profoundly isolating, especially if you have moved away from family for work.</p>

          <h3>Moving to a New City</h3>
          <p>India&apos;s migration patterns mean that millions of people are navigating new cities every year — Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai. Building a social life from scratch as an adult is genuinely hard. The friendships that used to form naturally in college take much more deliberate effort to cultivate at 25 or 30.</p>

          <h3>Social Anxiety and Loneliness</h3>
          <p>For many people, loneliness and social anxiety are intertwined. You want connection, but social situations feel overwhelming, exhausting, or unsafe. The result is a painful loop: isolation reinforces anxiety, which makes social engagement harder, which deepens isolation.</p>

          <h3>Loneliness in Joint Families</h3>
          <p>A quieter but equally real form of loneliness comes from living in a joint family where you can&apos;t speak openly. When your emotions and struggles must stay hidden for the sake of family harmony, you can feel utterly alone even in a house of ten people.</p>

        {/* How the app helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps With Loneliness</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is not therapy, and we are honest about that. We are peer support — real humans talking to real humans. Here is how we help:</p>

          <h3>Someone Who Has Actually Been There</h3>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners bring varied lived experiences and are screened for listening ability and boundaries. Review profiles to see the experiences and topics they mention; listeners are peer supporters, not therapists.</p>

          <h3>Available When Loneliness Peaks</h3>
          <p>Some people notice loneliness more at night or on weekends. How Was Your Day does not guarantee 24/7 listener availability; check the current list or request a conversation, which starts when a listener accepts.</p>

          <h3>Private and Judgment-Free</h3>
          <p>Some people find it easier to talk outside their usual circle. How Was Your Day listeners do not see your phone number, and you can choose a display name. Voice calls are not recorded, but text messages are stored and authorised administrators may review reported or safety-flagged sessions. Read the Privacy Policy and share only what feels comfortable.</p>

          <h3>A First Step Towards Connection</h3>
          <p>Talking about loneliness may help some people clarify what they are feeling or what kind of connection they want. Experiences vary; peer support is not treatment and does not replace professional help when it is needed.</p>
