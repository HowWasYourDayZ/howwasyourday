          <p>India&apos;s startup ecosystem has produced extraordinary companies. It has also produced an epidemic of founder burnout that nobody talks about publicly. The pressure to project confidence to investors, radiate energy to teams, and maintain a polished public narrative leaves founders with no safe outlet for honest conversation.</p>

          <h3>Startup Stress: The Daily Reality</h3>
          <p>Running a startup means living in permanent uncertainty. Runway that could end in months, a product that is not quite there yet, a team that depends on you, investors who need updates, and competitors who keep moving. The stress is not occasional — it is structural, constant, and exhausting in a way that is hard to explain to anyone who has not been there.</p>

          <h3>Fundraising Rejection</h3>
          <p>Getting rejected by 40 investors in a row, each one with a slightly different reason, is a particular form of psychological torture. The founders who stay standing through fundraising season develop a kind of armour — which also prevents them from processing the genuine toll that rejection takes. Every &quot;no&quot; is a small grief, and they accumulate.</p>

          <h3>Team Conflicts</h3>
          <p>Managing a team while being their biggest cheerleader, holding people accountable, making hard calls about performance, and maintaining culture — all while being the most stressed person in the room — is an enormous emotional labour that founders rarely acknowledge needing support with.</p>

          <h3>Co-Founder Conflict</h3>
          <p>Co-founder relationships are among the most intense professional relationships that exist. When they go wrong — through misaligned visions, unequal effort, communication breakdown, or simply growing apart — the impact is devastating both professionally and personally. Many co-founder splits feel like divorces.</p>

          <h3>Imposter Syndrome at Scale</h3>
          <p>As your startup grows, imposter syndrome often grows with it. The gap between how you present yourself to the world and how uncertain you feel internally can become unbearable. Many founders describe feeling like they are one bad board meeting away from being &quot;found out.&quot;</p>

          <h2>How the app Helps Founders</h2>

          <h3>Completely Outside Your Ecosystem</h3>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are not investors, advisors, or ecosystem contacts. There is no reputational risk. No version of what you say will reach your investors or team. You can be completely honest about your fear, your doubt, your exhaustion — without any professional consequences.</p>

          <h3>Founders Who Have Been Through It</h3>
          <p>Some of our listeners have been through the specific experience of running a startup — the failed fundraise, the key hire who quit, the product pivot that felt like starting over. They understand the context without needing it explained.</p>

          <h3>Available During Startup Hours</h3>
          <p>Founder stress peaks at unusual times — Sunday evenings before a Monday board call, 11 PM after a difficult investor meeting, the hour after you let someone go. How Was Your Day is available whenever you need to talk.</p>

          <h3>Not Advice — Presence</h3>
          <p>Founders get unsolicited advice constantly. How Was Your Day listeners know the difference between helping someone think through a problem and the far more valuable work of simply being fully present while someone else articulates what they are actually feeling.</p>
