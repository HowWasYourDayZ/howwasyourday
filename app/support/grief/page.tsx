          <h2>Understanding Grief</h2>
          <p>Grief is the natural response to loss. It is not a disorder, not a weakness, and not something to be gotten over quickly. It is the price of loving — and in a world that rarely makes space for it, carrying grief alone can be unbearable.</p>

          <div className="quote">&quot;Grief is just love with no place to go.&quot; — Jamie Anderson</div>

          <h3>Loss of a Loved One</h3>
          <p>The death of a parent, partner, sibling, friend, or child is a loss that reshapes everything. The world after looks fundamentally different. Grief after the death of someone central to your life is not something to be rushed or fixed — it is something to be accompanied through.</p>

          <h3>Pet Loss</h3>
          <p>Pet loss is often disenfranchised grief — mourning that society does not fully recognise or validate. But for millions of people, their pet was their most consistent source of daily comfort, companionship, and unconditional love. The pain of losing a pet is real and deserves to be treated as such.</p>

          <h3>Pregnancy Loss and Miscarriage</h3>
          <p>Miscarriage, stillbirth, and infertility-related grief are among the most isolating experiences a person can face. These losses are often invisible — no social rituals, minimal acknowledgment, and frequently minimised by well-meaning people. The grief is profound, the isolation is compounded, and the pressure to &quot;try again&quot; can feel suffocating.</p>

          <h3>Ambiguous Grief</h3>
          <p>Ambiguous grief refers to losses that are not clear-cut — grieving a parent with dementia who is still alive but no longer the person you knew; grieving an estranged family member; grieving a relationship that ended without closure; grieving a previous version of yourself after illness or a major life change. These losses lack social scripts, which makes them particularly hard to process.</p>

          <h3>Complicated Grief</h3>
          <p>For some people, grief does not follow the path toward gradual integration. It intensifies, persists, and prevents engagement with life in ways that go beyond normal mourning. If grief feels overwhelming many months after a loss, if you cannot imagine life ever feeling meaningful again, speaking with a mental health professional alongside peer support is important.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>How LeanOn Supports Grief</h2>

          <h3>Listeners Who Know Loss From the Inside</h3>
          <p>Every LeanOn listener who supports people through grief has personally experienced significant loss. They know what it is like to wake up and for one moment forget — and then remember. They know the ambush of grief in the middle of a normal day. They know this because they have lived it.</p>

          <h3>No Pressure to Feel Better</h3>
          <p>One of the most painful things about grief is the social pressure to recover on someone else&apos;s timeline. Family members become impatient. Friends want the &quot;old you&quot; back. LeanOn listeners understand that grief has its own timeline and will never rush you or minimise what you are carrying.</p>

          <h3>Available at Night and on Hard Days</h3>
          <p>Grief tends to be hardest at anniversaries, on holidays, on days that would have been significant, and at night. LeanOn listeners go online at different hours, including late at night, so when the grief wave hits at 2 AM or on what would have been their birthday, you have somewhere to go.</p>

          <h3>Private Space to Grieve Openly</h3>
          <p>Indian cultural contexts can make open grief complex — expectations to be strong, religious frameworks that prescribe certain expressions of mourning, family dynamics where you feel you must hold others together. LeanOn gives you a completely private space to grieve without any of those pressures.</p>
