          <p className="lead">Racing heart before a meeting. Rehearsing a sentence five times before you say it out loud. Avoiding weddings and family functions because being watched and judged feels unbearable — social anxiety touches millions of people in India, even though it is rarely called by its name. LeanOn connects you with peer listeners who have lived through social anxiety themselves, in a space with zero pressure to perform.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Social Anxiety in India</h2>
          <p>Social anxiety is far more than nervousness before a big event — it is a persistent, exhausting fear of being watched, judged, or embarrassed in front of others. In India, where social life is deeply woven into family, community, and career, social anxiety can feel especially isolating because so much of daily life happens in groups.</p>

          <h3>Shyness, Introversion, or Social Anxiety?</h3>
          <p>It is easy to dismiss social anxiety as &quot;just being shy&quot; or introverted, but they are not the same. Introverts often enjoy social interaction in smaller doses and recharge alone by choice. Someone with social anxiety, on the other hand, may desperately want connection but be gripped by an intense fear of judgment, humiliation, or saying the wrong thing — often with racing thoughts, a pounding heart, and physical discomfort well before the situation even begins.</p>

          <h3>The Weight of Constant Social Scrutiny</h3>
          <p>India&apos;s collectivist culture means that relationships, reputation, and approval are constantly on display — at weddings, family gatherings, and community festivals, everyone seems to have an opinion about your choices, your career, your marriage, your weight, your life. For someone with social anxiety, this near-constant scrutiny can turn a joyful family function into a source of dread weeks in advance, and workplace hierarchy adds another layer, where junior employees often fear speaking freely in front of seniors.</p>

          <h3>In the Classroom and the Interview Chair</h3>
          <p>Many students in India describe a specific kind of fear tied to raising a hand in class, presenting a project, or being cold-called by a teacher — the fear is rarely the material, it is being seen and judged while answering. That same fear resurfaces powerfully during job interviews, when a single evaluative conversation can feel like your entire future hinges on not stumbling over your words.</p>

          <h3>When the Meeting Room Feels Like a Stage</h3>
          <p>In professional settings, social anxiety often shows up as dread before meetings, avoidance of public speaking, and a constant, exhausting fear of being silently judged by colleagues. You might rehearse a two-line update for an hour, or say nothing in a meeting even when you know the right answer, because the fear of being wrong in front of others outweighs the value of speaking up.</p>

          <h3>Social Media&apos;s Comparison Trap</h3>
          <p>Scrolling through curated highlight reels of other people&apos;s confidence, achievements, and social lives can quietly deepen social anxiety. It becomes easy to believe that everyone else finds social situations effortless, which only intensifies the shame and self-consciousness around your own struggle — when in reality, far more people feel this way than ever post about it.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>How LeanOn Helps With Social Anxiety</h2>
          <p>LeanOn is not therapy, and we are honest about that. We are peer support — real people who understand social anxiety from the inside, offering empathy instead of advice you didn&apos;t ask for. Here is how we help:</p>

          <h3>Listeners Who Have Lived It</h3>
          <p>Our listeners have personally navigated social anxiety — the racing thoughts before a meeting, the dread of a wedding invitation, the interview that felt like a trial. They bring genuine empathy, not textbook responses, because they have sat exactly where you are sitting now.</p>

          <h3>A Pressure-Free Way to Be Heard</h3>
          <p>For many people with social anxiety, even reaching out feels like a social risk. LeanOn offers a text-based option alongside calls, so you can open up at your own pace without the in-person pressure of eye contact, tone, or being watched. It is an empathetic space designed to feel safe, not performative.</p>

          <h3>Practicing Connection Before It Counts</h3>
          <p>Talking to a listener who won&apos;t judge you is a low-stakes way to practice being heard. Many users find that after a few sessions, expressing themselves in real-world conversations — with a colleague, a friend, a family member — starts to feel a little less terrifying.</p>

          <h3>Support Before the Moment That Scares You</h3>
          <p>Social anxiety often peaks in anticipation — the night before an interview, the morning of a wedding, an hour before a big presentation. LeanOn listeners go online at different hours, so you can talk through your nerves right before the moment that scares you, not days later in a scheduled appointment.</p>

          <h3>Privacy That Removes the Fear of Judgment</h3>
          <p>The fear of being judged is at the core of social anxiety, so privacy matters enormously. LeanOn conversations are anonymous and confidential — no one from your family, college, or workplace will ever know you reached out, which makes it far easier to be completely honest.</p>
