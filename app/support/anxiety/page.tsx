          <h2>Understanding Anxiety in Modern India</h2>
          <p>Anxiety is not just feeling nervous before a presentation. It is a persistent, often exhausting experience of worry, physical tension, and mental restlessness that can significantly impact your quality of life. And in today&apos;s India, the triggers are everywhere.</p>

          <h3>Work Anxiety</h3>
          <p>The pressure of India&apos;s competitive job market — layoffs, performance reviews, toxic managers, always-on culture — creates a specific kind of work anxiety that is hard to escape. When your livelihood feels perpetually at risk, the nervous system stays in near-constant alert.</p>

          <h3>Exam Anxiety</h3>
          <p>From board exams to JEE, NEET, CAT, UPSC, and professional certifications, India&apos;s exam culture places enormous pressure on students. Exam anxiety is not about being weak — it is the predictable result of extremely high stakes combined with enormous family and social expectations.</p>

          <h3>Health Anxiety</h3>
          <p>Health anxiety (sometimes called hypochondria) involves excessive worry about having or developing a serious illness. In the era of Google-diagnosed symptoms and medical misinformation, health anxiety has become increasingly common — and deeply isolating, because it is often dismissed by others.</p>

          <h3>Relationship Anxiety</h3>
          <p>Anxiety in relationships — fear of abandonment, overthinking every text, feeling like you are &quot;too much&quot; — is one of the most painful and least understood forms of anxiety. It can derail otherwise healthy relationships and leave you feeling broken.</p>

          <h3>Racing Thoughts at Night</h3>
          <p>Many people with anxiety describe their worst moments as nighttime — lying in bed with a mind that will not slow down, replaying conversations, catastrophising about the future, unable to sleep. This mental chatter is a hallmark of anxiety, and it is treatable.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps With Anxiety</h2>

          <h3>Listeners Who Have Been There</h3>
          <p>Every How Was Your Day listener with anxiety expertise has personally navigated it. They know what a panic attack feels like from the inside. They know the specific misery of health anxiety. They know how hard it is to explain to someone who has never experienced it why you just cannot &quot;calm down.&quot;</p>

          <h3>A Non-Judgmental Ear</h3>
          <p>One of the most painful parts of anxiety is feeling like you cannot talk about it — friends get impatient, family minimises it, colleagues would think less of you. How Was Your Day gives you a private space to say everything without editing yourself.</p>

          <h3>Grounding and Coping Insights</h3>
          <p>Our listeners share what has actually worked for them — breathing techniques, grounding practices, ways of reframing anxious thoughts — not as prescriptions, but as peer insights from people who have tried these things in real life.</p>

          <h3>Available During Anxiety Peaks</h3>
          <p>Anxiety does not respect business hours. How Was Your Day listeners go online at different hours, including late at night, so when the spiral hits at midnight or your chest tightens before a Monday morning meeting, you have someone to reach out to immediately.</p>
