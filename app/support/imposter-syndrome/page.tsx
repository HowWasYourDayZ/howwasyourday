          <p className="lead">That nagging feeling that you are a fraud who got lucky — even after years of hard work and real achievement — is one of the most common experiences among high-achieving Indian professionals and students. LeanOn connects you with peer listeners who have personally battled imposter syndrome in top companies, campuses, and careers, and come out the other side.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Imposter Syndrome in India</h2>
          <p>Imposter syndrome is the quiet, exhausting feeling that you do not really belong — that your achievements are a fluke, and that sooner or later, everyone will find out you are a fraud. In a country that measures worth in ranks, marks, and college brand names, this feeling runs especially deep.</p>

          <h3>What Is Imposter Syndrome, Really?</h3>
          <p>First described by psychologists studying high-achieving women, imposter syndrome is the persistent belief that your success is due to luck, timing, or fooling people — never your own competence. It has nothing to do with actual ability. Some of the most accomplished people in any room are the ones most convinced they do not deserve to be there.</p>

          <h3>Why First-Generation Achievers Feel It Most</h3>
          <p>India produces thousands of first-generation engineers, doctors, and managers every year — people who cracked JEE or NEET or a campus placement from a small town with none of the coaching or exposure their classmates had. Reaching the IIT, the IIM, or the top consulting firm is the hard part. What often follows is a quieter struggle: sitting in a room full of people who seem effortlessly confident, and wondering if you were let in by mistake.</p>

          <h3>Imposter Syndrome Among Women in Tech and Finance</h3>
          <p>Women in male-dominated fields like technology and finance report imposter syndrome at especially high rates. A promotion can trigger doubt instead of pride — the fear that it was a diversity checkbox rather than a reflection of skill. Being the only woman in the room adds a layer of scrutiny that makes ordinary self-doubt feel like proof.</p>

          <h3>The LinkedIn Highlight Reel and &quot;Log Kya Kahenge&quot;</h3>
          <p>Social media has turned career progress into a public performance. Every promotion, every offer letter, every &quot;humbled to announce&quot; post adds to a quiet sense that everyone else is racing ahead effortlessly. Layer on Indian family expectations — the ever-present worry about what relatives and neighbours will think — and self-doubt gets nowhere to breathe.</p>

          <h3>An Education System Built on Ranks</h3>
          <p>From board exam percentages to JEE and NEET All India Ranks, Indian students grow up being reduced to a number and compared constantly — to siblings, cousins, classmates. This wires many people to tie their entire sense of worth to relative ranking, so even after landing a dream job or degree, the habit of chronic self-doubt does not simply switch off.</p>

        {/* How LeanOn helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How LeanOn Helps With Imposter Syndrome</h2>
          <p>LeanOn is not therapy, and we are honest about that. We are peer support — real humans who have faced the same inner critic, talking to real humans. Here is how we help:</p>

          <h3>Listeners Who Have Lived It</h3>
          <p>Our listeners include engineers, product managers, consultants, and graduate students who have personally battled imposter syndrome in top companies and elite campuses. They are not reciting theory — they know exactly what it feels like to sit in a meeting convinced you are about to be exposed.</p>

          <h3>A Space to Voice Self-Doubt Safely</h3>
          <p>Admitting self-doubt to a colleague or manager carries real risk in a competitive workplace — it can shape how you are perceived for years. LeanOn offers a private, empathetic space to say the quiet part out loud, without any impact on your professional reputation.</p>

          <h3>Hope From Someone Who Has Been There</h3>
          <p>Generic advice like &quot;just believe in yourself&quot; rarely helps. What does help is hearing, with empathy, from someone who felt exactly the same fraudulence and found their way past it — because it makes the possibility of moving forward feel real, not theoretical.</p>

          <h3>Before Your Big Moment</h3>
          <p>Performance reviews, promotion interviews, board exams, campus placements — the moments that matter most are often when imposter syndrome is loudest. LeanOn listeners are available for a judgment-free conversation right before those high-stakes moments, when you need steadying the most.</p>
