        {/* Understanding overthinking */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Understanding Overthinking</h2>
          <p>Overthinking is not a character flaw, and it is not something you chose. It is what a tired, caring mind does when it has something unresolved and no safe place to put it. Recognising the shape of it is the first step towards loosening its grip.</p>

          <h3>The 2 AM Thought Spiral</h3>
          <p>Nights are the worst because everything that kept you occupied has gone quiet. No meetings, no messages, no traffic. Your mind finally gets the floor and it uses it to run through every unfinished thing at once. Lying still in the dark also removes the small movements and distractions that normally break a thought before it settles. So the same worry circles back, louder each time, and every hour on the clock makes it feel more urgent. Nothing has actually got worse — it is just late, and you are alone with it.</p>

          <h3>Rumination vs Problem-Solving</h3>
          <p>They can feel identical from the inside, which is why overthinking is so convincing. Problem-solving moves — it asks what can I do, arrives at something, and lets go. Rumination replays — it asks why did this happen, what did they mean, what if it happens again, and never reaches an end because it was never looking for one. A useful test at 2 AM: has this thinking produced anything new in the last twenty minutes? If it is the same loop wearing a different sentence, your mind is not solving. It is circling, and it needs rest or company, not more thinking.</p>

          <h3>Overthinking Work and Career</h3>
          <p>In India, work is rarely just work. There is family expectation layered on top of it, comparisons with cousins and batchmates, the weight of a decision someone else partly made for you, and the constant background sense that you should be further along by now. So one offhand comment from a manager becomes three hours of analysis. A quiet appraisal cycle becomes a full imagined future. High-pressure work cultures give the mind endless raw material — and very few people you can say any of it to without it getting back to someone.</p>

          <h3>Replaying Conversations</h3>
          <p>Social overthinking has its own particular sting. You reread a message you sent hours ago, hunting for the wrong word. You replay a conversation from a party last week and cringe at something nobody else remembers. You watch someone go from replying quickly to replying slowly and write an entire story about what it means. Underneath it is usually a simple, deeply human worry: that you might not be wanted. The mind tries to solve that fear by reviewing the evidence again and again, but there is no amount of reviewing that ever settles it.</p>

          <h3>Why Suppression Backfires</h3>
          <p>The most natural response — just stop thinking about it — is the one that reliably fails. To push a thought away you have to keep checking whether it is gone, and every check brings it back. Add the second layer of frustration at yourself for still thinking about it, and now you have two loops instead of one. Thoughts tend to quieten not when they are forced out but when they are given somewhere to land: written down, or better, said out loud to another person who receives it without flinching.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How the app helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps You Break the Loop</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is not therapy, and we are honest about that. We are peer support — real humans talking to real humans. When your mind will not stop, here is what that actually does for you:</p>

          <h3>Saying It Out Loud Interrupts the Loop</h3>
          <p>A thought can repeat forever inside your head because it never has to finish. Speaking it to another person changes that. You have to find words, put them in order, and reach the end of the sentence — and somewhere in that process the thought stops being a fog and becomes a thing with edges. Most people notice it partway through: the worry that felt enormous at 2 AM sounds smaller in their own voice. That is not the thought being dismissed. It is the loop finally being interrupted.</p>

          <h3>Listeners Who Have Lived Their Own Spirals</h3>
          <p>Our listeners are not reading from a script about racing thoughts. They have had the sleepless nights, the reread messages, the week-long replay of one conversation. That lived experience shows up as real empathy rather than polite sympathy — they understand why you cannot simply put it down, because they could not either.</p>

          <h3>Available at 2 AM When It Peaks</h3>
          <p>Overthinking does not keep office hours. It peaks exactly when there is no one left to call and everyone you know is asleep. How Was Your Day listeners go online at different hours, so on the nights when you are staring at the ceiling and the loop is winning, there is a real person you can reach in a couple of minutes.</p>

          <h3>No Judgment, No Advice You Did Not Ask For</h3>
          <p>Most people, with the best intentions, respond to overthinking by trying to fix it — do not worry, it is nothing, just sleep. It rarely helps, and it often adds a quiet shame for still being stuck. How Was Your Day listeners are screened and expected to listen with empathy first. They will not tell you your worry is silly, and they will not hand you solutions you never asked for. You get to say the whole thing, uninterrupted, to someone who is genuinely there for it.</p>
