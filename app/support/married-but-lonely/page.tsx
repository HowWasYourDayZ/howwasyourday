        text: 'It is extremely common — and in India, rarely spoken about. Many women in marriages describe a specific loneliness: not the loneliness of having no one around, but the loneliness of having someone right there who still does not see you, hear you, or show up for you. The presence of a spouse does not automatically mean emotional company. When the gap between physical proximity and emotional connection is large, the loneliness can feel more acute than being single.',

      name: 'Why do I feel lonelier now that I am married than before?',
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Because expectations change with marriage. Before, you may have had a full life of friends, family, your own independence. Marriage often comes with relocation, reduced social time, increased domestic responsibility, and the expectation that your spouse will fill many of those needs. When they do not — when emotional support, companionship, and even financial partnership are absent — the gap is starker than it was when you did not expect those things from one person.',

        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'This is one of the most common situations — and one of the hardest to name, because "he is not a bad person" is often used to invalidate your own experience. You can simultaneously love someone, not want your marriage to end, and still feel deeply unseen by them. That loneliness is real and does not require a dramatic reason to justify it. Starting by naming it — to yourself, and eventually in a safe space — is often the first step.',

        text: 'Yes — especially for the specific kind of loneliness that is hard to talk about with family or friends. Telling your mother you are lonely in your marriage can feel like a betrayal, or invite unwanted advice, or worry people. A peer listener provides a space to say exactly how things are — without judgment, without it being repeated, without it becoming a family conversation.',

        <p>Why does loneliness grow inside a marriage that looks stable from the outside? <a href="/support/marriage-loneliness" style={{color:'#1A8FA0',fontWeight:800}}>Understanding loneliness in marriage →</a></p>

        <h2>Why This Is So Hard to Talk About in India</h2>
        <p>
          The cultural pressure around marriage in India is enormous. You are supposed to make it work.
          Family, neighbours, society — everyone is invested in the appearance of a functional marriage.
          Naming that you are lonely inside yours can feel like an act of disloyalty, an invitation to unwanted
          advice, or a confirmation of failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          So most women don't say it. Not to their mothers. Not to their friends. Not even to themselves clearly.
          They just carry the weight — managing everything, keeping the home together, presenting well —
          while the inside life empties out.
        </p>

        <h2>When Both Partners Are Carrying Things</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes the disconnect in a marriage comes from two people both drowning — both under pressure,
          both unable to give what the other needs. That does not make your loneliness less real.
          It does mean that what you need is not necessarily for your husband to change,
          but for you to have somewhere to put your experience.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">What LeanOn offers</div>
          <h3>A space that is just for you</h3>
          <p>
            Not couples counselling. Not a space where your husband&apos;s side of things is also weighed.
            A space where you can say what your experience actually is — without having to soften it for anyone
            else&apos;s comfort. Many women find that just being able to say it — clearly, honestly, to someone
            who is just listening — is itself a form of relief.

          <div className="card-label">What you do not have to do</div>
          <h3>Justify why you feel the way you feel</h3>
          <p>
            You do not have to prove that your marriage is bad enough to warrant feeling lonely in it.
            You do not have to say your husband is a bad person or that you want to leave.
            You can simply say: I am lonely in this, and I need somewhere to say that.
