        <h1>You Woke Up. That Was Already <em>Hard Enough.</em></h1>
        <p className="lead">
          There is a kind of tired that sleep does not fix. A dread that settles before you even open your eyes.
          Where the thought of facing the day — not anything specific, just the day — feels heavier than you can carry.
          This is not laziness. This is not weakness. This is what it feels like when you have been running on empty for too long.
        </p>

        <div className="crisis">

        </div>

        <h2>What Morning Dread Actually Feels Like</h2>
        <p>
          You open your eyes and the first thing is not a thought — it is a weight. A pre-thought heaviness.
          The alarm goes off and instead of getting up, you lie there negotiating with yourself. Five more minutes.
          Then five more. Then the mental calculation: what is the absolute minimum I have to do today?
        </p>
        <p>
          To everyone outside, you are "fine." You make it to work, to class, to whatever you have to do.
          You answer messages. You function. But inside there is this steady low hum of exhaustion,
          this sense of just getting through it rather than living it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India this particular experience is hard to name. We do not have good language for it.
          It is not dramatic enough to call depression. It is not acute enough to call a crisis.
          It just is — this grey weight that greets you every morning.
        </p>

            <div className="step-body">
              <h4>Accumulated pressure with no release</h4>
              <p>Career pressure, family expectations, financial worry, relationship stress — each one manageable alone, but together they compound. When there is no outlet, the body starts dreading the next round before it starts.</p>

              <h4>Disconnection from what you are doing</h4>
              <p>When your job, your role, your daily life does not feel like yours — when you are doing what was expected rather than what you chose — mornings become a reminder of that gap.</p>

              <h4>Chronic low-grade depression</h4>
              <p>Not the dramatic kind that people recognise. The functional kind — where you get through the day but feel nothing, want nothing, look forward to nothing. This has a name: dysthymia. It is real and it is treatable.</p>

        <h2>The Isolation Makes It Worse</h2>
        <p>
          One of the hardest things about morning dread is the loneliness of it.
          Everyone else seems to be waking up and getting on with things.
          You scroll your phone and see people going to the gym, making chai, posting their good morning.
          And you are lying there wondering what is wrong with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing is wrong with you. But you are probably carrying something alone that was never meant to be carried alone.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">What helps</div>
          <h3>Being heard before being advised</h3>
          <p>
            The instinct of everyone around you — family, friends, managers — is to tell you what to do.
            Get some exercise. Make a routine. Try gratitude journaling. These might eventually help.
            But first, someone needs to just hear that it is hard. Without immediately trying to fix it.

          Not therapists — but real humans who understand what it is like to dread the morning,
          to go through the motions, to feel like you are the only one carrying this particular weight.
