          <h1>Sunday Nights Don&apos;t Have to Feel This <em>Heavy</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">That specific dread that creeps in as the weekend winds down — the quiet, the looming week, the feeling that no one else is awake to talk to. How Was Your Day connects you with empathetic peer listeners who understand exactly what a Sunday night can feel like, right when it hits.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Understanding Sunday Night Loneliness */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Understanding Sunday Night Loneliness</h2>
          <p>Sunday scaries are one of the most widely recognised feelings out there — that mix of dread, anxiety, and low mood that shows up as the weekend ends. It is real, it is common, and it deserves to be talked about with the same empathy as any other kind of loneliness.</p>

          <h3>The Week Ahead Looms Before It Even Starts</h3>
          <p>Sunday evening is when Monday stops being an abstract idea and starts feeling like something you can already sense bearing down on you. Meetings, deadlines, and obligations you have not even thought about all week suddenly crowd in, and the dread of what is coming can feel heavier than anything that actually happens once the week begins.</p>

          <h3>From a Full Weekend to a Sudden Quiet</h3>
          <p>Whether your weekend was packed with people or spent mostly alone, Sunday night has a way of going quiet all at once. Friends log off to prepare for their own week, plans wind down, and the contrast between whatever noise the weekend had and the stillness of Sunday night can leave you feeling unexpectedly empty.</p>

          <h3>Living Alone or Far From Family Makes It Sharper</h3>
          <p>If you live by yourself or far from the people who know you best, Sunday night can hit especially hard. There is no one across the room to sit with you in the quiet, and the empty hours before Monday can stretch out in a way that makes the loneliness feel very present and very personal.</p>

          <h3>A New Week Amplifies What Is Already Unresolved</h3>
          <p>Sunday night has a way of surfacing everything you have been putting off — the conversation you have been avoiding, the goal you have not made progress on, the feeling you have been too busy to sit with all week. The idea of a "fresh start" on Monday can amplify whatever is already unresolved instead of easing it.</p>

          <h3>Recurring, Predictable, and Easy to Dismiss</h3>
          <p>Unlike loneliness that strikes unpredictably, Sunday night loneliness follows you on a weekly schedule. That regularity can make it easy to dismiss — "it's just Sundays" — but a feeling that returns every single week and quietly drains your evening is worth taking seriously, not shrugging off.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How the app helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps on a Sunday Night</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is not therapy, and we are honest about that. We are peer support — real humans talking to real humans, exactly when the Sunday scaries hit. Here is how we help:</p>

          <h3>Listeners Available During the Exact Hours It Hits</h3>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are available specifically during Sunday evening and night hours, right when the dread tends to be at its worst. You do not have to wait until Monday morning to talk to someone — help is there while you are actually feeling it.</p>

          <h3>Talk It Through Before the Week Starts</h3>
          <p>Carrying Sunday night dread into your week in silence tends to make it heavier by Monday morning. Talking it through with an empathetic listener before you go to bed can help you release some of that weight, so you start the week a little lighter instead of already behind.</p>

          <h3>Listeners Who Know This Exact Weekly Pattern</h3>
          <p>Many How Was Your Day listeners have their own experience with Sunday scaries — the same weekly dread, the same quiet evenings, the same pre-Monday anxiety. Talking to someone who genuinely recognises the pattern, not just loneliness in general, makes a real difference.</p>

          <h3>A Low-Pressure Way to End the Weekend</h3>
          <p>There is no appointment to book and no waitlist. You can open the app on a Sunday night, talk for a few minutes with someone who gets it, and end your weekend feeling a little less alone — even if nothing about Monday has changed.</p>
