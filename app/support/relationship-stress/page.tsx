        {/* What Is Relationship Stress */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Is Relationship Stress?</h2>
          <p>Relationship stress is the emotional and psychological strain that comes from conflict, uncertainty, or disconnection in your personal connections. It is not limited to romantic partnerships — it can arise in marriages, friendships, family dynamics, or even professional relationships. In India, where relationships are deeply tied to identity, duty, and social standing, the pressure can feel especially overwhelming and hard to escape.</p>

          <h3>Romantic Relationship Stress</h3>
          <p>Whether you are navigating disagreements with a partner, struggling with jealousy or insecurity, coping with a long-distance situation, or simply wondering whether the relationship is right for you — romantic relationship stress is exhausting. The uncertainty alone can keep you awake at night and make it difficult to focus on anything else.</p>

          <h3>Family Pressure and Conflict</h3>
          <p>In many Indian families, boundaries between individual needs and family expectations are blurry by design. Parents weighing in on career, marriage prospects, and lifestyle choices; sibling rivalries; expectations from in-laws — all of these create persistent stress that accumulates over time. Saying &quot;my family is the source of my stress&quot; often feels disloyal, which keeps the burden locked inside.</p>

          <h3>Friendship Breakdowns</h3>
          <p>Losing a close friend, feeling left out of a social group, or sensing that a friendship has become one-sided are sources of genuine grief that rarely get acknowledged. These losses are often dismissed with &quot;just find new friends&quot; — but meaningful adult friendships are genuinely hard to build and deeply painful to lose.</p>

          <h3>Toxic and Difficult Relationship Patterns</h3>
          <p>Some relationships leave you feeling smaller, more anxious, or more confused after every interaction. Recognising these patterns — and deciding what to do about them — takes real courage and clarity. Talking through your experience with someone who has been there can make that process significantly easier.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How Relationship Problems Affect Mental Health */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How Relationship Problems Affect Mental Health</h2>
          <p>The connection between relationships and mental health is bidirectional: relationship stress causes mental health problems, and mental health struggles put strain on relationships. Understanding this cycle is the first step to breaking it.</p>

          <h3>Anxiety and Overthinking</h3>
          <p>When a relationship is unstable or uncertain, the mind goes into overdrive — analysing messages, replaying conversations, imagining worst-case scenarios. This hyper-vigilance is exhausting and spills over into every other area of life including work, sleep, and physical health.</p>

          <h3>Loss of Self-Worth</h3>
          <p>Persistent conflict, criticism, or feeling unappreciated in a relationship erodes self-esteem over time. Many people in stressful relationships begin to question their own perceptions, needs, and even their right to feel upset — a pattern that compounds the original stress significantly.</p>

          <h3>Sleep Disruption and Physical Symptoms</h3>
          <p>Relationship stress is one of the most common causes of chronic sleep disruption. The emotional activation that comes from unresolved conflict makes it hard for the nervous system to settle at night. Over time, poor sleep compounds anxiety, reduces emotional resilience, and makes difficult situations feel even harder to navigate.</p>
        </div>

        {/* When to Seek Support */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>When to Seek Support for Relationship Stress</h2>
          <p>You do not need to reach a crisis point before you deserve support. Consider reaching out when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You find yourself replaying the same conversation or conflict again and again without resolution</li>
            <li>Relationship stress is affecting your work, sleep, appetite, or ability to enjoy things you normally love</li>
            <li>You feel like you have no one safe to talk to — not because your life is bad, but because the situation feels too complicated or sensitive to share</li>
            <li>You are unsure whether your feelings and reactions are reasonable and simply need a sounding board</li>
            <li>You want perspective from someone with no stake in the outcome — not a mutual friend, not a parent, not a colleague</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Reaching out early, before a situation becomes a full crisis, is always a sound decision. Peer support is low-stakes — you are just having a conversation, not committing to any particular course of action.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How Peer Support Helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How Peer Support Helps With Relationship Stress</h2>
          <p>Peer support works differently from therapy, advice from friends, or venting to family. Here is what makes it distinctively useful for relationship stress:</p>

          <h3>No Conflicting Interests</h3>
          <p>Friends and family are invested in the story. A peer listener has no prior relationship with you, no loyalty to the other person, and no social consequence if you tell the truth about what is happening. That neutrality is genuinely rare and valuable when you are in the middle of a charged situation.</p>

          <h3>Lived Experience, Not Theory</h3>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners have personally navigated difficult relationships — they have been through painful family dynamics, trust issues, and the confusion of troubled partnerships. They speak from experience, not from a framework, which makes their understanding feel real rather than clinical.</p>

          <h3>A Space to Think Out Loud</h3>
          <p>Often what people need most is not advice but a chance to hear themselves think. Peer listeners are present to listen actively, ask gentle questions, and reflect back what they hear — helping you gain clarity from your own words rather than from someone else&apos;s prescriptions.</p>
        </div>

        {/* What How Was Your Day Listeners Offer */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>What How Was Your Day Listeners Offer</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day peer listeners are real people — not bots, not professionals reading scripts — who have applied to support others because they have been through something difficult themselves. Here is what you can expect from a session focused on relationship stress:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A private, non-judgmental space to describe exactly what is happening without fear of being told you are overreacting</li>
            <li>Empathetic listening from someone who has personally experienced relationship challenges in an Indian context</li>
            <li>Gentle reflection and questions to help you understand your own feelings and needs more clearly</li>
            <li>Perspective from someone who has no stake in the relationship — no allegiances, no agenda, no judgment</li>
            <li>Availability any time, including late nights when relationship worries tend to be loudest</li>
          </ul>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners do not provide therapy, couples counselling, or legal advice. If your situation involves safety concerns, abuse, or serious mental health issues, please reach out to a qualified professional.</p>
