          <p className="lead">A layoff, a career switch decision, a mid-career crisis — these moments are some of the most disorienting and isolating a working adult faces. LeanOn connects you with peer listeners who have been through career upheaval and found their footing on the other side.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Career Confusion Is More Common Than You Think</h2>
          <p>In a country where career choices are heavily influenced by family expectations, social status, and financial security — and where admitting you hate your job feels like ingratitude — career confusion carries a particular weight in India.</p>

          <div className="scenarios">
            {[
              {label:'Getting Laid Off',desc:'The shock, shame, and practical scramble after losing a job'},

              <div key={i} className="scenario">{s.label}<div className="scenario-desc">{s.desc}</div></div>
            ))}
          </div>

          <h3>The Emotional Weight of Career Identity</h3>
          <p>In India, &quot;What do you do?&quot; is often the second question after &quot;What is your name?&quot; Our careers are deeply woven into our identity, our social standing, and our sense of worth. When a career feels wrong — or is forcibly disrupted by a layoff — it affects much more than income. It affects who you feel you are.</p>

          <h3>Layoffs in India&apos;s Tech Sector</h3>
          <p>The global tech layoffs of 2022–2024 hit India particularly hard, affecting hundreds of thousands of workers at companies from startups to MNCs. Many of these workers had built their entire financial plans around high-paying tech salaries. The combination of financial shock, bruised identity, and sudden uncertainty is a unique and brutal experience.</p>

          <h3>Engineering to Something Else</h3>
          <p>Millions of Indians studied engineering because it was the expected path — not because they loved it. Realising in your late 20s or 30s that you want to leave engineering for a creative field, a startup, or a completely different profession is a legitimate and increasingly common crossroads that comes with genuine grief and fear.</p>

          <h3>Mid-Career Crisis</h3>
          <p>The mid-career crisis is real and often arrives quietly in your late 30s — a growing sense of disconnection from your work, questioning whether the sacrifices you made were worth it, watching colleagues get promoted while you feel stagnant, and the creeping anxiety that you have been spending your best years building someone else&apos;s dream.</p>

          <h3>Salary Negotiation Stress</h3>
          <p>Many Indians, particularly women, leave significant money on the table because of anxiety around salary negotiation. In a culture where discussing money feels taboo and assertiveness is sometimes perceived as aggression, advocating for your own compensation can feel deeply uncomfortable. This is learnable — and talking to someone who has done it helps enormously.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>How LeanOn Helps With Career Confusion</h2>

          <h3>Not Advice — Perspective</h3>
          <p>Career coaches and counsellors give advice. LeanOn listeners share perspective — what it actually felt like to leave a stable job, survive a layoff, or make a career pivot. This lived experience is different and often more useful than professional guidance when you are in the thick of the confusion.</p>

          <h3>A Space to Say What You Cannot Say Elsewhere</h3>
          <p>You cannot tell your parents you hate your engineering career. You cannot tell colleagues you are thinking of quitting. You cannot admit to your spouse the extent of the financial fear. LeanOn is the private space where you can say all of it without consequences.</p>

          <h3>Normalising Career Non-Linearity</h3>
          <p>One of the most helpful things a peer listener can do is simply confirm that career confusion, pivots, and setbacks are normal — not signs of failure. Hearing this from someone who has been through it, not just read about it, lands differently.</p>

          <h3>Support Through the Transition</h3>
          <p>Career transitions are not events — they are processes that take months or years. LeanOn provides ongoing support through each phase: the shock, the grief, the uncertainty, the tentative exploration, and the rebuilding.</p>
