          <h1>Working From Home Shouldn&apos;t Mean Feeling <em>Invisible</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Millions of Indians now work from bedrooms, PGs, and one-BHKs across the country — productive, professional, and profoundly alone. How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners who understand what it&apos;s like to go an entire day without a real conversation, and who offer empathetic, judgment-free support whenever the silence gets too loud.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Understanding WFH loneliness */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Understanding Work-From-Home Loneliness in India</h2>
          <p>Remote and hybrid work gave many Indians flexibility, shorter commutes, and the freedom to live wherever they wanted. It also quietly removed the everyday human contact that used to hold their social life together. WFH loneliness is real, common, and rarely talked about openly.</p>

          <h3>The Invisible Social Scaffolding You Lost</h3>
          <p>Office life came with a kind of social scaffolding nobody noticed until it was gone — the coffee-machine small talk, the shared cab or metro commute, the lunch table conversations that had nothing to do with work. None of it felt important at the time. Working from home strips all of it away, leaving only the meetings, and meetings are not the same as connection.</p>

          <h3>Alone in a Metro City, Far From Family</h3>
          <p>A large number of remote workers moved to Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, or Gurgaon specifically for a job — and now do that entire job from a rented room, without the office that would have introduced them to people. Living alone in a metro city, far from family, with a job that never requires you to leave the house, can be one of the most isolating experiences in modern Indian life.</p>

          <h3>Muted Mics, Cameras Off, Meetings That Don&apos;t Feel Human</h3>
          <p>A day full of back-to-back calls can feel like a day full of people, but muted mics and cameras-off meeting culture quietly erodes real human connection. You can attend eight meetings and still not have had a single moment where someone asked how you actually are.</p>

          <h3>Work and Home, Blurred Into One</h3>
          <p>When your bedroom is also your office, the boundaries blur in both directions — it becomes hard to switch off from work, and just as hard to feel truly off duty and social once the laptop closes. This blur hits hardest for people who relocated to a city specifically for a job they now do entirely alone at home, with no office, no friend circle, and no clear line between working and living.</p>

        {/* How the app helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps With WFH Loneliness</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is not therapy, and we are honest about that. We are peer support — real humans talking to real humans, with empathy for exactly what remote work isolation feels like. Here is how we help:</p>

          <h3>Listeners Who&apos;ve Lived Remote-Work Isolation</h3>
          <p>Our listeners include people who have personally gone through WFH isolation — freelancers who went months without a real conversation, and employees who relocated for a fully-remote role and knew nobody in the city. They bring genuine empathy, not a script.</p>

          <h3>Available During Your Work-Day Breaks</h3>
          <p>You don&apos;t have to wait until the weekend. How Was Your Day listeners are available during a quick break between calls, or in the evening after a silent day of video calls when the quiet finally catches up with you.</p>

          <h3>Empathetic Conversation, No Performance Required</h3>
          <p>Work meetings ask you to be &quot;on&quot; — camera ready, articulate, upbeat. A conversation with a How Was Your Day listener asks nothing of the sort. It is empathetic, unhurried, and judgment-free, with no need to perform the way you do for a manager or a client.</p>

          <h3>A Human Connection That Isn&apos;t Another Screen Obligation</h3>
          <p>We know the last thing a burnt-out remote worker wants is one more screen-based obligation. How Was Your Day is designed to feel like the opposite of that — a genuine human connection point, not another item on your video-call calendar.</p>
