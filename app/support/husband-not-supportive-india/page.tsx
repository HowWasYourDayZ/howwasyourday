        text: 'Financial withdrawal in a marriage is a serious issue. Your practical options depend on your situation — whether you have your own income, what the legal framework is, whether children are involved. In India, a wife has legal rights to maintenance under the Hindu Marriage Act and other personal laws. Beyond the legal dimension, the emotional weight of financial abandonment — the stress, the loss of security, the practical burden — is real and deserves to be named and addressed. Talking to a peer listener is not a legal resource, but it can be a place to process the emotional experience while you figure out the practical steps.',

        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Emotional absence in a marriage is one of the most draining things to live with — particularly because it is hard to name. He is there. He is not doing something obviously wrong. He is just... not present. The coping that works long-term involves finding emotional connection and support outside of the marriage — friends, family, a peer listener, a therapist — without allowing the absence to be the only reality you inhabit. You also have to grieve, somewhere, what you expected and are not receiving. That grieving matters.',

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The feeling that "so many people have a problem with me, therefore something must be fundamentally wrong with me" is one of the most common things women in difficult relational situations report. It is also one of the least reliable ways to understand reality. The people who have problems with you may each have their own unprocessed burdens, competitive dynamics, or reasons that have very little to do with you. Multiple people being unhappy with one person is not proof that person is the problem — it can equally be a sign that that person is surrounded by people who are each struggling in their own way.',

How Was Your Day listeners are not relationship advisors and will not tell you what to do. What a peer listener can offer is a space to hear yourself clearly — to say what you are experiencing, what you need, what you are afraid of — which is often the first step in finding your own answer to that question.',

It is a space for you to be heard — not a couples intervention, not relationship coaching, not a space where your husband\'s perspective is also weighed. If couples counselling is something you want to pursue, a qualified relationship therapist is the right resource. How Was Your Day is for your experience, your weight, your needs — which matter independently of the marriage.',

        <h2>When Support Withdraws Gradually</h2>
        <p>
          It often does not happen all at once. First the emotional attunement goes — the asking how you are,
          the interest in your day, the warmth. Then the practical help tapers off. Then, sometimes, the
          financial contribution becomes unreliable or stops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each withdrawal is gradual enough that it is easy to explain away. He is stressed at work.
          He has his own pressures. Maybe I am expecting too much. And then you realise you have adjusted
          your expectations all the way down to nothing — and you are still disappointed.
        </p>


        <h2>The Two Kinds of Withdrawal</h2>
        <div className="cards">
          <div className="card">
            <div className="card-label">Emotional withdrawal</div>
            <h3>When the connection disappears</h3>
            <p>
              He stopped asking about your day. He does not respond when you try to share something.
              You can feel the absence of interest — in you, in the child, in the family.
              You learned to stop needing things from him because the disappointment became worse than the need.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="card">
            <div className="card-label">Financial withdrawal</div>
            <h3>When the partnership becomes one-sided</h3>
            <p>
              He has stopped contributing to the household. Whether by gradual reduction or sudden withdrawal,
              the financial weight has shifted entirely to you — even as you continue to carry the child,
              the home, and the emotional labour. This is a form of abandonment, even when no one names it.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Is Hard to Talk About</h2>
        <p>
          In India, naming that your husband is not supportive can feel dangerous.
          It can feel like you are airing private matters, being disloyal to the family,
          risking your marriage in the telling of it, or inviting judgment about whether you chose right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many women carry this entirely alone — managing the weight, keeping up appearances,
          telling no one how things actually are. The silence is protective and exhausting at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talking to a peer listener — anonymously, privately — is not the same as telling your family.
          It is telling yourself, with a witness. Sometimes that is what you need first.
        </p>
