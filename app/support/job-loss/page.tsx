          <h1>Losing a Job Isn&apos;t Losing Your <em>Worth</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">A layoff email takes thirty seconds to read and months to absorb. If you&apos;re staring at a laptop you no longer have a login for, wondering how to tell anyone — How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners who have been laid off themselves, and rebuilt. No appointment needed.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Understanding */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Understanding What Job Loss Really Takes</h2>
          <p>Everyone tells you it&apos;s just a job, that the market will turn, that you&apos;ll land somewhere better. Some of that may even be true. None of it touches what you&apos;re actually feeling in the first few weeks — because what you lost was never only the salary.</p>

          <h3>It&apos;s Grief, Not Just Unemployment</h3>
          <p>Job loss follows the shape of grief: the disbelief, the replaying of the last few weeks looking for the signal you missed, the anger at a manager or a founder or a spreadsheet, the flat exhaustion. People are often startled by how heavy it feels. It helps to know that you&apos;re not overreacting — you&apos;re mourning something real. Routine, colleagues, a place to be at 10 AM, and a plan for the next two years all disappeared in the same meeting.</p>

          <h3>When &quot;What Do You Do?&quot; Has No Answer</h3>
          <p>In the UK or Ireland, that question shows up within ninety seconds of meeting anyone — at a wedding, in a WhatsApp group, in the lift. For years you had a clean answer with a company name in it. Now you have a pause. That pause is where the identity collapse lives. It isn&apos;t vanity. Most working professionals have quietly built a large part of their self-concept on their designation, and losing it feels like losing a part of yourself, not just a source of income.</p>

          <h3>The Secret Months</h3>
          <p>This is the part almost nobody talks about. Plenty of people don&apos;t tell their family for weeks. They keep waking at the same hour, dressing, packing a laptop bag, and leaving the house — to a café, a co-working space, a library, sometimes just a long drive — because the alternative is a conversation they can&apos;t face yet. If you&apos;re doing this, you&apos;re not being dishonest. You&apos;re buying yourself time to feel steady enough to speak. But carrying it entirely alone is what makes it unbearable, and that is exactly the gap a peer listener can fill.</p>

          <h3>Financial Anxiety Lives in the Body</h3>
          <p>Money worry rarely stays in your head. It shows up as a 4 AM wake-up with your heart already racing, a tight chest when a payment reminder arrives, a stomach that refuses food, weeks of shallow sleep. Watching your runway shorten while you refresh job boards is a specific kind of stress, and it wears down the very energy you need for interviews. Naming it out loud, to someone who has felt the same thing, will not pay a bill — but it does loosen the grip enough to think clearly.</p>

          <h3>The Shame That Is Specific to Us</h3>
          <p>Indian families read employment as status, stability, and a signal about your future. A layoff can quietly reshape how relatives speak to you, stall a marriage conversation, and revive expectations you thought you had outgrown. There is the fear of becoming the cautionary story in a family WhatsApp group. There is the guilt of parents who sacrificed for your education. None of this is rational and all of it is real — and it is far more common than the confident LinkedIn posts suggest.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How the app helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is not therapy and not career coaching, and we are honest about that. It is peer support — one human who has been through this, listening to another. Here is what that looks like after a layoff:</p>

          <h3>Someone Who Has Actually Been Laid Off</h3>
          <p>Our listeners include people who were let go in startup shutdowns, cost-cutting rounds, and abrupt terminations — and who came out the other side. They are not reciting advice from an article. They know the specific silence of the morning after, and the empathy they offer comes from having lived it rather than studied it.</p>

          <h3>A Place Where You Don&apos;t Have to Perform Optimism</h3>
          <p>LinkedIn demands that you be grateful, energised and open to opportunities within days. Family demands that you be reassuring. Friends want you to be fine. Somewhere in all that, nobody asks how you actually are. On How Was Your Day you can say the ungracious things out loud — that you feel humiliated, that you resent people who kept their jobs, that you are frightened — and be met with empathy instead of a pep talk.</p>

          <h3>Available at the Hours the Anxiety Spikes</h3>
          <p>Job-loss anxiety keeps unsociable hours. It arrives at 2 AM, on Sunday evenings, and in the twenty minutes after a rejection email. How Was Your Day listeners go online at different hours, so you are not left holding a 3 AM spiral by yourself until the world wakes up.</p>

          <h3>Completely Private</h3>
          <p>Nothing you say here reaches your professional network, your former colleagues, your recruiters, or your family. There is no profile anyone can find, no post anyone can screenshot, no mutual connection who might mention it. You can be fully honest about your situation without a single social consequence — which is often the only condition under which people can finally say the truth.</p>
