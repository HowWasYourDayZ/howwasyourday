      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Research suggests that women in India — even those in full-time professional careers — carry a disproportionate share of domestic labour, childcare, and emotional management within the family. This "double shift" — a full workday followed by a full domestic shift — means working women in India are doing significantly more total work than their male partners, with significantly less recognition of the invisible load. The cultural expectation that this should be done without complaint, cheerfully, adds another layer.',

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The symptoms overlap significantly, but career burnout for women often has an additional dimension: the identity question. For many professional women, their career is tied to their sense of self — competence, autonomy, identity outside of family roles. When work becomes overwhelming, or when a career break forces them to step back, the loss is not just of income but of a piece of who they are. This makes career burnout for women particularly complex to navigate.',

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Career breaks for women in India are common and often unavoidable — but the identity erosion that accompanies them is rarely acknowledged. You were someone with a professional identity, colleagues, a domain of expertise, and a daily structure. Losing that, even temporarily, even for something you chose, involves a genuine grief. Naming it — that this is a loss you are carrying alongside the love for your child — is the beginning of navigating it honestly. You do not have to pretend you are only grateful.',

A real person who listens to what you are actually experiencing — the stress, the exhaustion, the feeling of being invisible at home while performing perfectly at work — and receives it without trying to fix it.',

        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'This is one of the most common things professional women say. Having material stability does not inoculate against emotional exhaustion, loneliness, or feeling unseen. In some ways it makes it harder to name — the cultural and internal message is "you have everything, what is there to complain about?" But emotional needs are not cancelled out by career success or financial security. Struggling is not a function of how good your life looks from the outside.',

        <h1>You Work a Full Day. Then You Come Home and <em>Work Another One.</em></h1>
        <p className="lead">
          For working women in India, the day does not end when you leave the office. It continues — at home,
          in the kitchen, with the children, in the mental load of managing everyone else's lives alongside your own.
          You are expected to perform brilliantly at work and seamlessly at home, without ever visibly struggling.
          That is not a reasonable expectation. And it is exhausting.

        <h2>The Invisible Things Nobody Counts</h2>
        <p>
          The mental load of a working woman in India includes: remembering everyone's appointments,
          anticipating what the household needs before it runs out, managing relationships with both families,
          tracking the child's development, navigating in-law expectations, managing finances, and doing
          all of this while maintaining a professional identity at work.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of this shows up in any metric. None of it is acknowledged as work. And most of it
          is invisible until it is not done — at which point it becomes a failure.
        </p>

        <h2>When You Have to Take a Career Break</h2>
        <p>
          Pregnancy complications, childcare gaps, a family health crisis — there are many reasons
          working women in India step back from their careers. The loss is rarely acknowledged fully.
          Income stops. Professional identity is suspended. The gap in your CV begins to feel like an accusation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when you are ready to restart — whether it is a business you planned for years or a job
          you want to return to — there are often new obstacles: family resistance, practical barriers,
          a sense that your window has narrowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frustration and grief of this is completely legitimate. And it deserves to be heard.

            I feel invisible, I do not know where I went" — and be received without advice, without fixes,
            without it being turned into someone else&apos;s problem.
