      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Maternal burnout is the state of complete physical and emotional exhaustion that comes from sustained over-demand in the parenting role — usually when there is not enough support, rest, or acknowledgement. It can appear at any stage of motherhood, not just in the early postpartum period. Postpartum depression is a clinical condition that appears in the weeks and months after birth, involving persistent low mood, disconnection, and sometimes difficulty bonding. Both are real and both deserve support. If you are struggling, speaking to a doctor about whether clinical support is needed is always worth considering.',

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'No — and this is perhaps the most important thing to say. Burnout is what happens when a person gives more than they are receiving over a sustained period. Mothers in India are often expected to give everything — constantly, cheerfully, without complaint. The burnout that results is not a sign of failure. It is the natural consequence of an impossible standard applied without adequate support. Loving your child and being burnt out by the role are not contradictions. They coexist in most mothers, most of the time, in a system that does not provide enough.',

        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The short, honest answer: it is very hard, and there is no fix that does not involve either the situation changing or your needs being otherwise met. What can help is not carrying the experience alone. Naming — even to a neutral person — what you are actually doing, what you are not receiving, and how you feel is a form of relief. It is also a step toward clarity about what you need and how to advocate for it. How Was Your Day peer listeners are not relationship coaches, but they can listen without judgment while you figure out what you are carrying and what you need.',

        text: 'Yes — completely. Listeners agree to keep what you share confidential. You do not need to share your real name. What you share in a session stays there. Many people find that the anonymity of How Was Your Day is specifically what makes it possible to say the things they cannot say to family or friends — including the messy, ambivalent, exhausted parts of parenting that feel too vulnerable to share with people who know your child.',

        <h2>Signs of Maternal Burnout</h2>
        <div className="burnout-signs">
          {signs.map((s, i) => (
            <div key={i} className="sign">
              <div className="sign-dot" />
              <p>{s}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>


        <h2>Why Maternal Burnout Is Particularly Hard in India</h2>
        <p>
          In India, mothers are expected to be selfless. To prioritise the child, the family, the household —
          always. There is almost no cultural permission to say: I am burnt out by this role that I also love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practical support structures that exist elsewhere — affordable childcare, parental leave for
          both parents, community parenting networks — are either absent or inaccessible for most women.
          Many mothers in India are doing the work of two or three people, without acknowledgement and without rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The burnout that results is not a personal failure. It is what happens when demand vastly exceeds support,
          over a sustained period, with no one asking how the person doing all the giving is actually doing.
        </p>

        <h2>What Helps</h2>
        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">First thing</div>
          <h3>Saying it out loud to someone who just listens</h3>
          <p>
            Not someone who will tell you to be grateful. Not someone who will make you feel guilty.
            Not someone who will immediately tell you what to do. Just someone who will hear it —
            that you are tired, that you need a break, that you are more than just this role —
            and receive it without judgment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">Worth knowing</div>
          <h3>Burnout is not permanent, but it needs attention</h3>
          <p>
            Maternal burnout left unaddressed does not resolve on its own — it deepens. The more you
            keep giving without replenishing, the less there is. Recognising it, naming it, and
            finding even small ways to be heard and supported are not luxuries. They are maintenance.
