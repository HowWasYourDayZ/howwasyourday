          <h2>The Reality of Student Life in India</h2>
          <p>India&apos;s education system is one of the most demanding in the world. The stakes attached to competitive examinations, the family expectations that surround academic success, and the lack of adequate mental health support in most educational institutions create a perfect storm of student stress.</p>

          <h3>IIT-JEE and NEET Pressure</h3>
          <p>Preparing for JEE Advanced or NEET means years of intensive preparation, often starting as early as Class 8. Kota coaching factories, 16-hour study days, rank lists that determine your worth — this system puts enormous strain on developing minds. The psychological cost of this pressure is only beginning to be acknowledged publicly.</p>
          <p>And when you do not clear the exam on the first attempt? Or do not get the rank you needed? The grief of that moment — combined with family reactions, financial cost, and the sense of a lost year or years — is real and profound.</p>

          <h3>Hostel Homesickness</h3>
          <p>Leaving home for the first time to live in a hostel — often hundreds of kilometres from family — is a significant adjustment that Indian students are rarely prepared for. Hostel homesickness involves missing family, navigating unfamiliar food and routines, making new friends from scratch in a competitive environment, and doing all of this while maintaining high academic performance.</p>

          <h3>Campus Bullying and Ragging</h3>
          <p>Despite regulations, ragging and campus bullying remain serious problems in many Indian educational institutions. The power dynamics of senior-junior relationships, gender-based harassment, and social exclusion can cause lasting psychological harm. Students who experience this often feel they have no one to turn to — LeanOn offers a private, judgment-free space to talk.</p>

          <h3>Imposter Syndrome at Top Colleges</h3>
          <p>Many students who worked years for admission to IITs, NITs, AIIMS, or top private colleges arrive and immediately feel like they do not belong — surrounded by students who seem smarter, more confident, more prepared. This experience is extremely common, but because everyone is performing confidence, it can feel uniquely personal.</p>

          <h3>Career Anxiety</h3>
          <p>As students approach graduation, career anxiety becomes acute — placement pressure, the gap between expected and actual salaries, family expectations about career stability, and the fear of choosing the wrong path. Many students feel paralysed by these decisions and have no one to talk to who has been through it recently.</p>

          <h2>How LeanOn Helps Indian Students</h2>

          <h3>Listeners Who Survived the System</h3>
          <p>Our listeners include people who have navigated JEE drops, NEET attempts, college adjustments, and career pivots. They are not counsellors reading from textbooks — they are young adults who have been exactly where you are and have perspective to offer.</p>

          <h3>Completely Private</h3>
          <p>Many students cannot talk honestly about how they are struggling — parents would panic, friends are competing, teachers do not understand. LeanOn is completely private. Nothing you say reaches your family, institution, or peers.</p>

          <h3>Available During Exam Season</h3>
          <p>Stress peaks during exam periods, late at night when revision feels impossible and panic sets in. LeanOn listeners go online at different hours, including during board exam weeks, JEE season, and final placements.</p>

          <h3>No Judgment About Your Academic Choices</h3>
          <p>Whether you want to switch streams, take a gap year, leave engineering for art, or are questioning whether the career your family chose for you is actually what you want — LeanOn listeners will not judge your choices. They will help you think through them.</p>
