          <h2>Understanding Long-Distance Relationship Loneliness</h2>
          <p>Long-distance relationships in India are more common than people realise — migration for work, higher studies abroad, and job postings across cities mean millions of couples are navigating love through screens. This loneliness is often invisible because, on paper, everything looks fine.</p>

          <h3>A Relationship That Exists Mostly Through a Screen</h3>
          <p>When most of your relationship happens through calls, texts, and video chats, you miss the small, wordless parts of being with someone — a hand on your shoulder after a bad day, sitting quietly in the same room. That absence can be quietly exhausting even when the calls themselves go well.</p>

          <h3>When Even a Phone Call Feels Like Scheduling a Meeting</h3>
          <p>Time-zone gaps turn spontaneous connection into logistics. You end up checking clocks in two cities before you can just say hello, and a conversation that should feel natural starts to feel like something you have to plan around work, sleep, and everyone else&apos;s calendar.</p>

          <h3>The Familiar India-Specific Pattern</h3>
          <p>Partner moved abroad for a master&apos;s degree or a job in the US, UK, Canada, the Gulf, or Australia. Or you are both in India but in different cities, chasing careers that will not let you be in the same place yet. Either way, the relationship is real and committed — the distance is just the current chapter.</p>

          <h3>The Guilt of Not Wanting to Worry Them</h3>
          <p>You had a hard day, but your partner is thousands of kilometres away with their own pressures, and your one call a day is precious. So you stay quiet about the stress, the argument with your boss, the low mood — and end up carrying it alone instead of sharing it, because it feels unfair to spend limited time on something heavy.</p>

          <h3>Missing the Ordinary Moments, Not Just the Big Ones</h3>
          <p>It is rarely the anniversaries or the video calls on festivals that hurt the most. It is wanting to tell them about something small right when it happens, or wishing they were there for an ordinary Tuesday evening — the small, unremarkable togetherness that distance quietly takes away.</p>
        </div>

        {/* How the app helps */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is not couples counselling and we do not offer relationship advice. We are peer support for how you are feeling — a space that is entirely yours, separate from the relationship itself.</p>

          <h3>Somewhere to Put What You Don&apos;t Want on Their Plate</h3>
          <p>When contact time with your partner is limited, a How Was Your Day listener gives you somewhere to process the hard parts of your day without it costing your partner anything. That way, the time you do get together can stay about connection, not damage control.</p>

          <h3>Listeners Who Have Lived This Themselves</h3>
          <p>Our listeners have navigated their own long-distance relationships — partners abroad, cities apart, long engagements across time zones. They bring genuine, empathetic understanding of this specific texture of loneliness, not generic relationship talk.</p>

          <h3>Available Regardless of Your Time Zone</h3>
          <p>Whether you are up at odd hours waiting for your partner&apos;s call, or it is a quiet weekday afternoon while they sleep on the other side of the world, How Was Your Day listeners go online at different hours, so you can often find someone when the loneliness actually shows up.</p>

          <h3>Anonymous and Separate From Your Shared World</h3>
          <p>A How Was Your Day conversation is completely separate from your partner&apos;s world and your shared social circle. You can be fully honest about how you feel without it reaching your partner, your families, or anyone you both know.</p>
