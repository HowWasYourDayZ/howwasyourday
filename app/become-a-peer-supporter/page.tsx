    q: 'What does a How Was Your Day peer supporter do?',
    a: 'Listens. Someone who feels lonely, stressed, heartbroken or stuck talks to you one to one, by text or voice, and you listen without judging, fixing or advising. You are a peer who has been through something similar — not a therapist or counsellor, and you never give medical advice.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who can become a peer supporter?',
    a: 'Adults aged 18 or older, based in India, who have personally been through something hard — loneliness, a breakup, family pressure, burnout, grief, anxiety, study or work stress — and have come far enough through it to sit with someone else\'s pain without being overwhelmed. No degree or qualification is needed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How are peer supporters selected?',
    a: 'Everyone goes through the same steps: a written application about your lived experience and the topics you can support, a screening quiz on boundaries, crisis referral and empathetic responses, a live selfie check to confirm you are a real person, and a manual review by How Was Your Day. Not every application is approved. There is no training programme — you are screened.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this a job or a way to earn money?',
    a: 'No. How Was Your Day is a support service for people who need someone to talk to. Peer supporters are compensated for completed sessions, but sessions are never guaranteed and most supporters have only a few. If you are looking for income, a side hustle or work from home, How Was Your Day is not the right place.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if someone is in crisis?',
    a: 'Peer supporters are not crisis counsellors. If someone may be in danger, you point them to Tele-MANAS (14416, free, 24/7) or NIMHANS (080-46110007) and can flag the session to How Was Your Day.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much time does it take?',
    a: 'You choose when you are available. When you are online, people who need to talk can reach you; sessions are 5 to 45 minutes. You should only be online when you can give someone your full attention.',
