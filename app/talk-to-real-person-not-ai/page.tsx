          <h2>The problem with talking to AI about loneliness</h2>
          <p>
            When you&apos;re feeling lonely or overwhelmed, you might open ChatGPT or ask Gemini for help.
            It responds quickly. The words sound right. But something feels hollow — and that&apos;s not
            your imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI does not listen. It generates. Every response is a statistical prediction of what words
            should come next, trained on text from the internet. When it says &quot;I understand&quot; —
            it does not. It has never felt loneliness, loss, or the specific weight of being misunderstood
            by someone you love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talking to AI about loneliness can actually make things worse: you get the illusion of
            connection without the reality of it. The relief is temporary. The emptiness returns.

          <h2>What real human support looks like</h2>
          <p>
            A How Was Your Day listener does not read from a script. They bring their own life — their own experience
            of heartbreak, uncertainty, grief, or confusion — into the conversation. When you say &quot;I
            feel completely alone even though I&apos;m surrounded by people&quot;, a real listener knows
            exactly what that means. Not because they were trained on text that includes that phrase. Because
            they have felt it.
