        <p className="lead">
          You know you need to talk to someone. You looked into therapy — $200 a session, three-week waitlist,
          and a therapist who has never heard of an H-1B and will need the whole cultural backstory before
          you can get to how you actually feel. How Was Your Day peer listeners are Indian, need no appointment, and cost a fraction
          of the cost.

          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>A single therapy session costs $150-$250 — even with insurance, copays add up fast.</li>
            <li>Good therapists in cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and New York have months-long waitlists.</li>
            <li>Culturally informed therapists who understand the South Asian experience are even rarer.</li>
            <li>The stigma around mental health in many Indian families means you cannot talk to family about seeking help.</li>
            <li>American mental health apps feel generic and transactional — not designed for the Indian experience.</li>

          <h2>💡 Peer support is real support</h2>
          <p>Peer support is not a lesser option — it is a well-evidenced form of emotional care. Being
            genuinely heard by another human being reduces loneliness, helps regulate emotions, and provides
            perspective in a way that no app or algorithm can.</p>
          <p>For many people, a good peer listener is exactly what they need — not clinical treatment,
            just real human connection and warmth.</p>
