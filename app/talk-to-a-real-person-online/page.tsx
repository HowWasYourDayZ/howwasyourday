    "You may know what the advice says and still want to talk. You may have friends but not want to burden them, or family but not want to explain everything. You may simply want a neutral human being to listen for a while.",

    "How Was Your Day is built around one-to-one peer support. It is not positioned as therapy, counselling or an AI companion.",
    "You choose a listener rather than receiving a generic response. The goal is a human conversation where you can talk, vent, reflect or simply not feel alone for a while.",
    "You can start without committing to a long programme: sessions start at 8 minutes, followed by paid time only if you choose to continue."

    "You want to say something you would rather not say to people you know.",
    "You have been using AI for information but still want human conversation.",
    "You need to vent without turning the conversation into a debate or advice session.",
    "You are dealing with loneliness, relationship stress, work pressure, grief or a difficult week.",
    "You want a private conversation but do not need clinical treatment.",
    "You simply want someone to listen."
