  {
    id: 'lean-on',
    term: 'Lean On',
    partOfSpeech: 'verb / phrase',
    definition: 'To "lean on" someone means to rely on them emotionally — to draw support, comfort, or strength from another person during a difficult time. The phrase comes from the physical act of leaning on someone for balance or rest.',
    example: '"I don\'t know what I would have done without her. She was always someone I could lean on."',
    related: 'emotional support, peer support, How Was Your Day',
    detail: 'The concept of leaning on others is central to human resilience. Research suggests that social support — having people to lean on — is one of the strongest predictors of wellbeing and recovery from adversity. How Was Your Day (the platform) is named after this idea: making it possible for anyone to find someone to lean on, at any time.',
  },
  {
    id: 'peer-support',
    term: 'Peer Support',
    partOfSpeech: 'noun',
    definition: 'Emotional and social support given by a person who has lived experience of a similar challenge. Peer support is based on shared experience, empathy, and mutual understanding rather than clinical expertise.',
    example: '"Talking to someone who had been through their own burnout was more helpful than any book I read."',
    related: 'peer counselling, peer listener, lived experience',
    detail: 'Peer support has a well-established evidence base. Research suggests that people with lived experience of a challenge are often uniquely effective at supporting others going through the same thing — because they understand from the inside, not just theoretically. Peer support is not a replacement for clinical care, but it fills an important gap that therapy alone cannot.',
  },
  {
    id: 'peer-listener',
    term: 'Peer Listener',
    partOfSpeech: 'noun',
    definition: 'A person who provides emotional support through active listening, based on their own lived experience of challenges similar to the person they are supporting. On How Was Your Day, peer listeners are verified real people, not bots or therapists.',
    example: '"My peer listener had been through a difficult divorce too. She didn\'t give me advice — she just listened and understood."',
    related: 'peer support, active listening, lived experience',
    detail: 'Active listening — giving full attention, withholding judgment, and reflecting what the person is saying — is the core skill of peer listening. It is more than just hearing words; it is understanding the emotion and experience behind them.',
  },
  {
    id: 'emotional-support',
    term: 'Emotional Support',
    partOfSpeech: 'noun',
    definition: 'The provision of empathy, care, and understanding to someone experiencing stress, difficulty, or emotional pain. Emotional support focuses on acknowledging and validating a person\'s feelings, rather than solving their problems.',
    example: '"I didn\'t need advice. I just needed someone to tell me that what I was feeling made sense."',
    related: 'peer support, active listening, social support',
    detail: 'Research distinguishes between instrumental support (practical help), informational support (advice), and emotional support. Emotional support — simply being heard and understood — is often the most valuable, particularly in the acute phase of distress.',
  },
  {
    id: 'peer-counselling',
    term: 'Peer Counselling',
    partOfSpeech: 'noun',
    definition: 'A form of support in which individuals with similar life experiences provide guidance, encouragement, and understanding to one another. Peer counselling is distinct from licensed professional counselling.',
    example: '"The peer counselling programme connected students who had experienced exam anxiety with juniors going through the same thing."',
    related: 'peer support, peer listener, counselling',
    detail: 'Peer counselling is widely used in schools, universities, and community settings. It is particularly effective in cultures where professional mental health support carries stigma, as the informal nature of peer relationships can make it easier to open up.',
