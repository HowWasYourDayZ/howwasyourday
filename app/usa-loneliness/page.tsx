        <p className="lead">
          The American Dream has a side nobody posts on Instagram. Huge houses, good salaries, and a loneliness
          so deep it sometimes feels worse than anything you left behind. If you are Indian and living in the USA,
          you already know what we are talking about.

          <h2>NRI loneliness looks very specific</h2>
          <p>It is not just &quot;feeling sad.&quot; It is something very particular to being Indian in America:</p>
          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>Suburbs where you drive everywhere and know no one on your street.</li>
            <li>A big Indian community in the Bay Area or New Jersey — but somehow still feeling completely alone.</li>
            <li>Missing India for Diwali, missing weddings, missing funerals you could not attend.</li>
            <li>WhatsApp calls with family that end and leave you feeling more alone than before.</li>
            <li>American colleagues who are polite but never really warm — no one invites you home.</li>
            <li>Being the &quot;model minority&quot; means you are not allowed to be struggling.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You want to call someone but it is 9:30 AM in Mumbai and they are rushing to work.
            You do not want to be a burden. So you scroll your phone until you fall asleep, alone with it.</p>

          <h2>Why American therapy often misses the point</h2>
          <p>You book a therapist — $200 an hour, six-week waitlist — and spend half the session explaining

            sympathetically but they do not really understand the cultural weight of it all.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are people who have lived the Indian experience. Many are themselves NRIs or
            have family abroad. They do not need the background explained. They already get it.</p>

            <h3>Why do Indians in the USA feel so lonely even in big cities?</h3>
            <p>American suburbs are designed around cars, not community. You can live next to someone for five years
              and never learn their name. Add H-1B pressure, cultural displacement, and missing India — the
              loneliness becomes deeply specific and hard to explain.</p>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3>Is there someone I can talk to who understands NRI loneliness?</h3>
            <p>Yes. How Was Your Day peer listeners include many Indians who have lived the NRI experience — the immigration
              stress, the culture shift, the missing home. They understand in a way most American counselors do not.</p>
