          <h1>What Is <em>How Was Your Day</em>?</h1>
          <p className="lead">How Was Your Day is India&apos;s peer support platform — named after the act of leaning on someone. Real humans. Real understanding. Available any time, anywhere in India. No appointment needed.</p>
        </div>

        {/* The name meaning */}
        <div className="meaning-card">
          <h2>&ldquo;Lean on&rdquo; — What It Means</h2>
          <p>To <strong>lean on</strong> someone means to draw on their emotional strength when yours is running low. To trust them with your weight. To let another human being hold part of what you&apos;re carrying. How Was Your Day (one word, one platform) gives everyone access to that — to real people who have been through what you&apos;re facing and found their way through.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Why How Was Your Day exists */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Why How Was Your Day Was Built</h2>
          <p>In India, millions of people are struggling silently. With loneliness, burnout, grief, anxiety, relationship pain, career confusion. They need someone to talk to — but therapy is expensive, stigmatised, and hard to access. AI chatbots feel hollow. Friends don&apos;t always understand. Family often can&apos;t be trusted with certain struggles.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day was built to fill that gap. It connects people with <strong>peer listeners</strong> — real individuals who have personally navigated the same challenge, and come out the other side. They&apos;re not therapists. They&apos;re not AI. They&apos;re human beings who get it.</p>

          <h3>The How Was Your Day Promise</h3>
          <p>Every person who comes to How Was Your Day deserves someone who truly understands. Not a script. Not a diagnosis. A human being who has been there, and is ready to listen without judgment. That is the How Was Your Day promise — and everything we build is in service of it.</p>

          <p>Whether you see it written as <em>How Was Your Day</em>, <em>howwasyourday</em>, or <em>lean on app</em> — it all points to the same platform, the same promise, and the same community of real humans ready to listen.</p>
