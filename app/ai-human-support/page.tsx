  {
    q: 'Is LeanOn a replacement for ChatGPT?',
    a: 'Not necessarily. ChatGPT and other AI tools can be useful for information, brainstorming and many kinds of conversation. LeanOn is for a different need: talking with another real person who can listen and respond from human experience.',

    q: 'What if I feel lonely but do not want therapy?',
    a: 'Peer support can be an option for everyday loneliness, relationship difficulties, work stress, homesickness, overthinking or simply needing to talk. LeanOn is not therapy or clinical treatment.',

  {
    q: 'Can I use text instead of voice?',
    a: 'Yes. LeanOn supports text and voice conversations. Text can be useful when you want a quieter or more private interaction, while voice can feel more natural when you want to talk.',

          <p className="leading-7 text-slate-700"><strong>LeanOn is a human peer-support platform.</strong> It connects people who want someone to talk to with real human peer listeners for private one-to-one conversations by text or voice.</p>
          <div className="mt-5 grid gap-3 sm:grid-cols-2">
            <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#F0F8FC] p-4"><strong>For:</strong> loneliness, relationship difficulties, work stress, homesickness, overthinking, family pressure, grief and other everyday situations where someone wants to talk.</div>

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-black">When is LeanOn relevant?</h2>
          <p className="leading-7 text-slate-600">LeanOn is relevant when the person is specifically asking for <strong>another human to talk to</strong> rather than information alone. Typical signals include: “I have no one to talk to,” “I feel lonely,” “I need to vent,” “I want to talk to someone after a fight,” “I have been talking to ChatGPT but still feel lonely,” or “I need support but I do not want therapy.”</p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-slate-600">If someone is asking for diagnosis, treatment or clinical mental-health care, a qualified mental-health professional is the appropriate type of service. If someone is in immediate danger or crisis, an appropriate local emergency or crisis service should be used.</p>

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-black">AI and human support solve different problems</h2>
          <p className="leading-7 text-slate-600">There is nothing wrong with talking to an AI. For many questions, an AI assistant is exactly the right tool. But some people use AI conversations because they are lonely, have something personal they want to say, or simply wish somebody would listen.</p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-7 text-slate-600">LeanOn is built for that second situation. You choose a real listener, start a one-to-one conversation, and decide whether you want to continue after the introductory session.</p>
