      name: 'What is the difference between a psychiatrist, psychologist, and counsellor in India?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can diagnose mental health conditions and prescribe medication. They are the right person to see for conditions like severe depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or when medication is part of the treatment. A psychologist holds a postgraduate degree in psychology and can do psychological assessment and therapy — they cannot prescribe medication. A counsellor is typically trained in counselling or psychotherapy (not always a clinical degree) and focuses on talk therapy for emotional difficulties, life challenges, and mental health support. For most people navigating everyday emotional difficulties — numbness, anxiety, difficult relationships, unprocessed past experiences — a counsellor or psychologist is the right starting point. If something feels more acute or medication might be relevant, a psychiatrist is the path.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'How much does therapy actually cost in India?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Private therapy in metro cities typically ranges from ₹1,500 to ₹5,000 per session for a qualified psychologist or counsellor. Psychiatrists vary widely — from ₹500 at government hospitals to ₹3,000+ in private practice. Online therapy platforms have made rates more accessible in some cases, with some counsellors offering sessions from ₹500–₹1,000. Government hospitals and medical college OPDs can provide consultation and therapy at very low or no cost, though waiting times can be long and quality varies. The honest answer is that for regular, quality therapy, you are looking at ₹6,000–₹20,000 per month for weekly sessions — genuinely inaccessible for many.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Are there free or subsidized mental health services in India?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Yes. Government district mental health programs (DMHP) offer free services at government hospitals. Medical college psychiatry departments often have free or very low-cost OPD clinics. NIMHANS in Bangalore is a government institute where consultation is subsidized. Tele-MANAS (14416) is the Government of India’s free tele-mental health helpline. Some NGOs and community health organizations offer sliding-scale or free therapy — Sangath (Goa and online), The MINDS Foundation, and similar organizations. Online platforms like YourDOST and Wysa offer accessible-cost counselling. These require research and persistence to access, but they exist.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Can I use LeanOn while I\'m looking for a therapist?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Yes — that is one of the most honest uses of LeanOn. You know you need professional help. You are working on finding and accessing it. In the meantime, you are carrying things alone that feel heavy, and you could use a real person to talk to about how you are feeling. LeanOn is not therapy. It will not do what a therapist does. But it can help you feel less alone, help you clarify what you are experiencing, and provide real human support while you navigate toward professional care. Many people find that talking to a peer listener also helps them figure out what they want to say to a therapist when they finally get an appointment.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What should I tell a therapist when I first meet them?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Whatever you actually want help with — in whatever words you have for it. You do not need to have it organised or diagnosed. You can say "I have been feeling numb for years," "I have been struggling with mornings," "something happened in my teenage years that I think is still affecting me," or simply "I don\'t feel okay and I don\'t know why." A good therapist will take it from there. The first session is usually an intake — they are asking questions to understand your situation. You do not need to perform being more distressed or more together than you are. Just say the true thing.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'How do I know if I need a therapist or if peer support is enough?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'If your difficulties are significantly affecting your ability to function — relationships, work, basic self-care — a therapist is the appropriate level of support. If you are carrying something long-term that you have never processed, a therapist can provide the depth of work that peer support cannot. If you are in crisis, professional help is essential. Peer support is most valuable for: the ongoing emotional weight of being a person, situations where you need to be heard and to think out loud, times when you are waiting for professional access, and the kind of human connection that does not require a clinical relationship. The honest answer is that for most people, both serve different needs — and accessing professional help when you can is worth pursuing alongside peer support, not instead of it.' },

        <div className="section">
          <h2>You Already Know You Need Help. That Clarity Is Valuable.</h2>
          <p>It took something — time, honesty, maybe years of quietly carrying things — to get to the point of saying &quot;I need professional help.&quot; That is not a small thing. Many people never get there. They dismiss their experience, tell themselves others have it worse, keep waiting for things to improve on their own. You have already moved past that.</p>
          <p>The clarity you have — that what you are experiencing is real, that you deserve support, that what you have been doing is not enough — is the hardest part of the journey. Everything after this is logistics. Difficult logistics, in a country where mental health infrastructure is genuinely inadequate. But logistics, not a question of whether you deserve help or whether your experience is real enough.</p>
          <p>It is. You do.</p>
          <p>The gap between knowing you need professional help and being able to access it in India is wide and real. Cost: private therapy is ₹1,500–₹4,000 per session, and weekly therapy runs ₹6,000–₹16,000 a month — genuinely inaccessible on most Indian salaries. Availability: qualified mental health professionals are concentrated in metros, scarce in smaller cities. Stigma: even for people who can afford therapy, the family, social, and workplace pressure against seeking help is significant. Waiting: good therapists often have waiting lists.</p>
          <p>None of this is your fault. It is a systems failure, not a personal one.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Why Accessing Professional Help in India Is Genuinely Hard</h2>
          <p>India has approximately 0.3 psychiatrists per 100,000 people — compared to 13 per 100,000 in developed countries. The mental health treatment gap (the percentage of people who need help and do not receive it) is estimated at over 80%. This is the context in which you are trying to access care.</p>
          <p>The specific barriers most people hit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> A single private therapy session costs roughly what a person earning ₹30,000 per month earns in a day. Weekly therapy is not financially feasible for most of the people who need it.</li>
            <li><strong>Access in non-metros:</strong> If you are not in Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, or Chennai, the options narrow dramatically. Online therapy has improved this, but quality and affordability remain inconsistent.</li>
            <li><strong>Stigma:</strong> Even when therapy is available and affordable, the fear of family finding out, colleagues knowing, a record existing — keeps many people from accessing it. In India, mental health stigma is not just cultural, it can have real consequences for employment, marriage prospects, and family relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Not knowing who to see:</strong> The difference between a psychiatrist, psychologist, and counsellor is not well understood. Many people see the wrong kind of professional for their needs, or see someone unqualified because they did not know what to look for.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear of the process itself:</strong> What happens when you walk into a therapist&apos;s office? What if they judge you? What if you have to talk about things you are not ready for? The unknown is its own barrier.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What to Do Right Now — Before the Therapy Appointment</h2>
          <p>The most important thing to do right now is not to wait. Waiting for the &quot;right&quot; moment, the right budget, the right circumstance — while the weight continues to build — makes everything harder. There are things you can do today that will matter.</p>
          <p><strong>Talk to someone.</strong> LeanOn is not therapy. But it is a real person, with no appointment, who will listen without judgment to whatever you are carrying. For the cost of a session (a fraction of a therapy appointment), you can have a real conversation with someone who has navigated their own difficult experiences. That conversation — the act of saying things out loud to another human being — is not a substitute for therapy, but it is not nothing. It often helps people clarify what they are experiencing well enough to then go to a professional with greater clarity.</p>
          <p><strong>Start the search while you are waiting.</strong> Even if therapy is not accessible right now, begin orienting toward it. Research what is available in your city or online. Look at government hospital options. Ask your company HR if there is an Employee Assistance Program (many larger companies offer a few free therapy sessions through EAPs). Check whether any university clinics in your area offer low-cost therapy.</p>
          <p><strong>Say it out loud somewhere.</strong> The isolation of carrying this alone is its own weight. Whether through LeanOn, a trusted friend, or a family member who can hold it carefully — saying what you are going through to another person matters. You do not have to carry this entirely inside.</p>

          <h2>LeanOn Is Not Therapy. Here Is What It Is.</h2>
          <p>This page would not be honest if it told you LeanOn is a substitute for professional care. It is not. If you have been carrying things for years — numbness since your teenage years, the effects of a difficult childhood, a depression that is affecting your ability to function — you need, and deserve, a trained professional. A therapist or psychologist who can work with you over time, who has the clinical tools to help you process what you are carrying at a structural level.</p>
          <p>But here is what LeanOn is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A real person, with no appointment, who has navigated their own hard experiences and is screened and expected to listen without judgment</li>
            <li>A space to say things out loud that you have never said — to have them witnessed by another human being without being dismissed, fixed, or alarmed</li>
            <li>A way to feel less alone in what you are carrying while you work toward professional support</li>
            <li>A conversation that often helps people clarify what they are experiencing, and what they want to say when they get to a therapist</li>
            <li>No appointment, from anywhere, privately — listeners never see your phone number</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Someone who knows they need professional help can still use LeanOn while they wait for it — knowing it is not therapy. The professional help may not be available right then, the weight is real right then, and a real conversation with a real person is better than nothing.</p>
          <p>Better than nothing is underselling it. Being heard — by a person, not an algorithm, in real time, without judgment — does something. It does not do everything. But it does something real. And for many people, that something is where the movement toward getting the bigger help begins.</p>
