How Was Your Day fills the large gap between "I need to talk to someone" and "I need clinical intervention" — a gap that most people fall into most of the time.',

          <p className="lead">Most people searching for online counseling in India are not looking for a diagnosis. They need someone to talk to — real, screened, confidential, and affordable. How Was Your Day is that: peer listeners with no appointment, from ₹160 for 15 minutes.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Most People Actually Need When They Search &quot;Online Counseling&quot;</h2>
          <p>The phrase &quot;online counseling&quot; has become shorthand in India for something much simpler than what clinical therapy provides: a person to talk to about a problem that feels too heavy to carry alone. Not a diagnosis. Not a prescription. Not a structured treatment plan. Just someone who will listen, understand, and not judge.</p>
          <p>This is the gap that most people are trying to fill when they type that search. They have a relationship situation they cannot discuss with anyone in their life. Or a career pressure that is building quietly. Or a general feeling of being stuck that they cannot quite articulate. They are looking for a space to say it out loud to a real person.</p>
          <p>Formal therapy — even online — often does not match this need. It is structured around clinical frameworks, regular appointments, and treatment goals. It is excellent for clinical conditions. But most people most of the time are not dealing with clinical conditions. They are dealing with the ordinary but overwhelming weight of being human.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling misunderstood at home but not knowing how to say it</li>
            <li>Career anxiety that will not turn off when you try to sleep</li>
            <li>A friendship or relationship that is quietly deteriorating</li>
            <li>The particular loneliness of not having anyone to talk to about any of this</li>
          </ul>
          <p>How Was Your Day is built for exactly this. Not instead of therapy — alongside it, or as a first step toward it, or as the thing that fills the space where therapy is not accessible or appropriate.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>The Cost Problem With Therapy in India</h2>
          <p>A session with a licensed therapist in India costs between ₹1,500 and ₹5,000 per hour. In major cities like Mumbai and Delhi, established therapists routinely charge more. The recommended minimum for therapy to be effective is one session per week. Do the math: meaningful therapy costs ₹6,000–₹20,000 a month.</p>
          <p>For the vast majority of Indians — including people working salaried jobs in tier-1 cities — this is genuinely unaffordable as a regular expense. Mental health is consistently deprioritised because the cost feels impossible to justify when rent, food, EMIs, and family obligations take precedence.</p>

          <h3>Health Insurance Does Not Help</h3>
          <p>Even those with health insurance in India find that mental health coverage is either non-existent or capped at amounts that cover only a handful of sessions per year. The Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 mandates parity, but implementation has been slow, and most insurers still have significant exclusions.</p>

          <h3>Wait Times Make It Worse</h3>
          <p>The therapist-to-population ratio in India is approximately 1 per 100,000 people — one of the lowest in the world. Good therapists have waitlists. The idea of getting help &quot;now&quot; — when you actually need it — is largely theoretical in the public mental health system. Private therapists are faster but expensive.</p>

          <h3>What How Was Your Day Costs Instead</h3>
          <p>A 15-minute peer support session on How Was Your Day costs ₹160. A 30-minute session is ₹249. A 45-minute session is ₹329. New users get a free 5-minute trial. You do not need insurance, a referral, a prescription, or an appointment. You open the app, browse who is online right now, and start talking.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What a Peer Listener Is (And Is Not)</h2>
          <p>Peer support is a specific and well-researched form of emotional support. A peer listener is someone who has personal lived experience with emotional difficulty — not a therapist reading from a textbook, but a person who has actually navigated hard things and been chosen for their ability to support others doing the same.</p>

          <h3>What a Peer Listener Does</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Listens actively without judgment or agenda</li>
            <li>Reflects back what you are saying so you feel genuinely heard</li>
            <li>Helps you process what you are feeling through conversation</li>
            <li>Draws on their own relevant lived experience when it helps</li>
            <li>Maintains complete confidentiality</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What a Peer Listener Does Not Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Diagnose any mental health condition</li>
            <li>Prescribe or recommend medications</li>
            <li>Provide therapy or clinical treatment</li>
            <li>Keep a formal record or case file</li>
            <li>Contact anyone else about what you share</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The distinction matters because it clarifies what How Was Your Day is for: the vast middle ground where most people live most of the time — not in crisis, not needing clinical intervention, but carrying something heavy and needing someone to share the weight with.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Who Uses How Was Your Day Instead of Traditional Counseling</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day users are not a narrow demographic. They are engineers and homemakers, students and managers, people in metros and people in smaller cities. What they share is a need that traditional counseling either cannot reach or does not fit.</p>

          <h3>People Who Cannot Afford Regular Therapy</h3>
          <p>For many users, How Was Your Day is the only form of emotional support they have access to. At ₹160 for a session, it is within reach for someone earning a modest salary. For people who genuinely cannot afford therapy, this is not a compromise — it is the option that actually exists.</p>

          <h3>People Who Do Not Want a Formal Record</h3>
          <p>In India, seeking mental health support still carries stigma in many contexts. People worry about records that could affect employment, relationships, or family dynamics. How Was Your Day is anonymous, generates no formal records, and requires no identification that links your real identity to what you share.</p>

          <h3>People Between Therapy Sessions</h3>
          <p>Some users see a therapist monthly but need support in between. How Was Your Day fills the gap — a place to process what has come up between sessions without waiting for the next appointment.</p>

          <h3>People Who Are Not Sure If They Need Therapy</h3>
          <p>Many people come to How Was Your Day because they are not sure if what they are experiencing warrants therapy. Talking to a peer listener often helps clarify this. Sometimes you leave feeling like you just needed to vent. Other times, the conversation reveals something deeper that a professional should help with. Either outcome is useful.</p>
