          Oman has a large and close-knit Indian community — and yet the loneliness of expat life can still feel very real. Whether it is late at night in Muscat when there is nobody to call, or a weight you cannot explain to your family back home, How Was Your Day gives you a real person to talk to. Anonymous, in your language.
