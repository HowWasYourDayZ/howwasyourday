          <h1>Peer Support in Mumbai — Because Mumbai's <em>Grind Gets to Everyone</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Mumbai never slows down — and neither do the pressures that come with living here. The commutes, the cost of living, the relentless competition, and the loneliness of a city that is too busy to notice you. How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners who have been through it and come out the other side.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Mumbai's unique emotional pressures */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Mumbai's Unique Emotional Pressures</h2>
          <p>There is a mythology around Mumbai — the city of dreams, where hustle is rewarded and ambition is the norm. What that mythology leaves out is the emotional cost of keeping pace with a city that never stops asking more of you.</p>

          <h3>The Commute That Grinds You Down</h3>
          <p>Mumbai's local trains carry millions of people every day — and each of those people is sacrificing hours of their life, their energy, and often their peace of mind to the daily ritual of getting somewhere. A 4-hour round commute from Virar to Churchgate is not just a logistical inconvenience. Over months and years, it is a significant contribution to exhaustion, resentment, and the feeling that life is passing you by in a train carriage.</p>

          <h3>The Cost of Living and Financial Anxiety</h3>
          <p>Mumbai is one of the most expensive cities in India. Rent in decent neighbourhoods — Bandra, Andheri, Powai, Lower Parel — consumes a disproportionate share of most salaries. Many Mumbaikars feel a quiet, persistent financial anxiety: working hard but not getting ahead, unable to save, watching the gap between their current life and the life they imagined grow wider each year. This chronic low-grade stress is one of the city's least-acknowledged mental health burdens.</p>

          <h3>Cutthroat Competition and Comparison</h3>
          <p>Mumbai concentrates India's most ambitious people in finance, media, entertainment, and corporate careers. The result is a constant, exhausting game of comparison. Who got the better role, the bigger salary, the nicer flat. In a city that runs on status and optics, it is very easy to spend years feeling like you are falling behind — even when by any objective measure, you are doing fine.</p>

          <h3>Loneliness in a City of Millions</h3>
          <p>Mumbai is dense and impersonal in equal measure. People live in small flats, work long hours, and commute in packed trains — yet genuine connection is surprisingly scarce. Making new friends as an adult in Mumbai is hard. Social events feel transactional. And the city's pace leaves little room for the slow, unproductive time that real friendships require. Many Mumbaikars describe feeling invisible despite being surrounded by people every hour of the day.</p>

          <h3>Relationships Under Mumbai Stress</h3>
          <p>Romantic relationships in Mumbai face unique pressures. Couples are often exhausted when they finally see each other. Space is limited — many couples live with families or in shared flats, making privacy scarce. The financial pressure of starting a life together in a city this expensive creates arguments and resentment. And the ambition that brought people to Mumbai can pull them in directions that strain even strong partnerships.</p>

        {/* How the app Helps Mumbai */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app Helps Mumbai Residents</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is peer support — not therapy. Real people, who have navigated real Mumbai pressures, available to listen without judgment and support without lecturing.</p>

          <h3>Talk to Someone Who Understands Mumbai</h3>
          <p>Our listeners include people who have spent years in Mumbai — who know what the Virar Fast does to your soul, what it feels like to turn 30 in a 1-BHK in Malad still wondering when real life starts, what it means to build a career in a city that rewards aggression and punishes sensitivity. That shared context matters more than any certificate.</p>

          <h3>No Commute Required</h3>
          <p>You have enough commuting to do. How Was Your Day sessions happen entirely on your phone or laptop. Talk from your office bathroom, your commute home, your bedroom after midnight. Support is available wherever you are, whenever you need it.</p>

          <h3>Affordable and Accessible</h3>
          <p>Therapy in Mumbai can cost ₹2,000 to ₹5,000 per session — and there are waitlists. How Was Your Day starts at ₹160 for 15 minutes, with no appointment. For the kind of emotional support that most Mumbaikars need most of the time — a caring human who listens without judgment — peer support is often the right tool.</p>

          <h3>Private and Confidential</h3>
          <p>In Mumbai's social and professional circles, vulnerability can feel like a liability. How Was Your Day is completely private. Your conversations stay between you and your listener. No one in your network will know unless you choose to tell them.</p>
