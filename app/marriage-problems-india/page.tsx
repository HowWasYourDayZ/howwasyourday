        <h1>When Your Marriage Feels Hard and <em>You Can&apos;t Tell Anyone</em></h1>
        <p className="lead">
          Marriage problems are one of the hardest things to carry alone — because in India, you are not
          supposed to carry them at all. You are supposed to make it work. Not complain. Not burden others.
          And definitely not admit that the thing everyone celebrated might not be what you hoped for.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">The short answer</div>
          <p>
            How Was Your Day lets you talk privately about your marriage — fights, distance, in-laws, an arranged
            marriage that is not working, thoughts of divorce — with a screened listener in India, by text or
            voice. Use any name; the listener never sees your number. You can choose a woman listener.
            Sessions from 8 minutes, then from ₹160 for 15 minutes. Not couples therapy, not legal advice.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="crisis">
          <strong>If you are in danger at home, contact the police or local emergency services first. If you are in distress or having thoughts of self-harm:</strong>
          Samaritans: <a href="tel:116123">116 123</a> · text SHOUT to 85258 (free, 24/7)
        </div>

        <h2>What marriage problems people talk about</h2>
        <p>
          There is no single shape a struggling marriage takes. These are the things people most commonly
          need a space to say out loud:
        </p>
        <div className="topic-list">
          {topics.map((t, i) => (
            <div key={i} className="topic-item">
              <div className="topic-dot" />
              <p>{t}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>


        <h2>You don&apos;t need to have all the answers</h2>
        <p>
          When people think about talking through marriage problems, they often imagine needing a goal —
          deciding whether to stay, deciding how to fix things, deciding something. But that is not how it
          usually begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the most valuable thing is much simpler: saying it out loud. Hearing yourself put words
          to what has been shapeless and heavy. Being heard by someone who is not going to react with alarm,
          or start telling you what to do, or repeat it to someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of a conversation is not always in the solution it produces. Sometimes it is in the
          relief of finally not carrying something alone for an hour.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">What happens in a session</div>
          <h3>You talk. They listen. No agenda.</h3>
          <p>
            A peer listener will not direct the conversation toward a particular outcome. They will not
            push you to leave or to stay. They will not tell you what your husband or wife &ldquo;should&rdquo; be doing.
            They are there to make space for your experience — whatever it is, without judgment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why not talk to family or friends?</h2>
        <p>
          Family and friends are invested in the outcome. Your mother wants your marriage to work.
          Your friends have opinions about your spouse. The people closest to you care about you — but
          that caring comes with stakes. When you tell them something, it affects how they see your partner,
          how they worry about you, what advice they push on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A peer listener has no stake. They do not know your husband or wife. They will never meet your
          in-laws. Your listener never sees your phone number, and nothing is shared with anyone in your life. That is exactly why many people find
          it possible to be more honest with a stranger about their marriage than with the people who love them.
        </p>

        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-label">The weight of keeping it inside</div>
          <h3>The shame of admitting it is not perfect</h3>
          <p>
            There is a particular shame that comes with marriage problems in India — not just the problem itself,
            but the admission that the marriage is not what it appeared to be. That the wedding happened, the
            family was happy, and now something is quietly wrong. Many people stay silent for years simply because
            saying it feels like it would make it more real, or let down everyone who was so certain it would work.
            That silence has a cost.
          </p>
