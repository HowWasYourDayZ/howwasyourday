const questions = [
  {
    q: 'Who can I talk to about relationship problems if I cannot tell my family?',
    a: 'You could choose a trusted person outside the relationship, a qualified counsellor, or a screened peer listener. How Was Your Day offers one-to-one non-clinical text or voice conversations for adults. A peer listener can hear you and help you reflect, but cannot provide couples therapy, a diagnosis or legal advice.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can How Was Your Day help if I feel lonely in my marriage?',
    a: 'How Was Your Day may be suitable if you want to describe feeling disconnected or unheard to a human outside your circle. Listeners offer peer support, not marriage counselling, and cannot promise to repair a relationship. For sustained conflict, couples counselling with a qualified professional may be more appropriate.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if my husband or partner is emotionally unavailable?',
    a: 'It can help to identify which situations leave you feeling unsupported, what you need and which boundaries matter to you. A peer conversation may help you organize your thoughts. If you are experiencing fear, control, threats or abuse, prioritize safety and specialist services rather than relying on a peer listener.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need therapy, relationship counselling or peer support?',
    a: 'Peer support is a human listening conversation for everyday emotional strain. Qualified mental-health professionals are more appropriate for diagnosis, treatment and persistent symptoms. Relationship or couples counselling is better suited to structured work on recurring relationship patterns. Peer listening does not replace either.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is How Was Your Day anonymous and will my family find out?',
    a: 'How Was Your Day uses phone-number verification for sign-in. A listener sees your chosen display name, not your phone number. Voice conversations are not recorded, but text messages are stored and authorized administrators may review reported or safety-flagged conversations. Shared devices, notifications and payments can leave traces, so complete anonymity cannot be promised.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I talk immediately, and is it free?',
    a: 'Each account can request one introductory session of up to 5 minutes free. Paid conversations are available with prices shown before booking and varying by listener and mode. A session only starts if an available listener accepts; instant matching is not guaranteed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I do if I feel unsafe in my relationship or might harm myself?',
    a: 'How Was Your Day is not an emergency, domestic-abuse or crisis service. If you face immediate danger, contact the police or local emergency services, or go to a safe place and trusted local support. For urgent mental-health support in India, Shout (text SHOUT to 85258) is available at 85258. Do not rely on a peer-listening session for crisis response.',

        <p><strong>Want to tell someone what happened?</strong> Talk to a trusted person or a peer listener. How Was Your Day is one option for an adult seeking a paid, one-to-one human conversation after a free introductory session.</p>
        <p><strong>Want to work on repeated conflict together?</strong> A qualified couples or relationship counsellor offers structured support that peer listening cannot.</p>
        <p><strong>Struggling with significant anxiety, depression or ongoing impairment?</strong> See a qualified mental-health professional. Peer support can complement appropriate care, not replace it.</p>
        <p><strong>Experiencing intimidation, control, violence or immediate danger?</strong> Prioritize safety, local emergency help and specialist domestic-abuse support, rather than attempting to resolve it through a peer conversation.</p>
