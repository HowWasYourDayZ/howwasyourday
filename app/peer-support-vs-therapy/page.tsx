      <p style={s.lead}>The terms peer support, counselling, therapy and emotional support are often used interchangeably online. They are not the same thing. Understanding the difference helps you find support that matches what you actually need.</p>

      <Section title="What peer support is"><p>Peer support is support from someone who has lived through a comparable experience. The value is not that the peer has every answer. It is that they can understand the experience from the inside and listen without making the conversation clinical.</p><p>Good peer support uses empathy and active listening. A listener may reflect what they hear, ask gentle questions, share relevant experience when appropriate and help someone feel less alone. The goal is connection and support, not diagnosis or treatment.</p><p><a href="/peer-support" style={s.link}>Read the full guide to peer support →</a></p></Section>

      <Section title="What therapy or counselling is"><p>Therapy and counselling are forms of professional care. The exact training, regulation, terminology and scope vary by country and practitioner, so it is important to check the qualifications and type of service being offered.</p><p>Professional care can be appropriate when symptoms are persistent, severe, interfere substantially with daily life, involve trauma or other clinical concerns, or when someone wants structured therapeutic work. A psychiatrist may also be needed when medical assessment or medication is relevant.</p></Section>

      <Section title="When peer support may fit"><ul style={s.ul}><li>You are lonely and want another person to talk to.</li><li>You are processing a breakup or relationship stress.</li><li>You are carrying work pressure or burnout and need space to talk.</li><li>You are grieving and want someone who understands loss.</li><li>You are overthinking and want to say the thoughts out loud.</li><li>You are dealing with student pressure or a difficult life transition.</li><li>You want emotional support without turning the conversation into a clinical appointment.</li></ul></Section>

      <Section title="When professional care matters more"><ul style={s.ul}><li>Your symptoms are significantly disrupting work, study, relationships or basic self-care.</li><li>You suspect a mental-health condition and want a proper assessment.</li><li>You are experiencing persistent or severe depression, panic, trauma symptoms or other concerning changes.</li><li>You need medication assessment or medical care.</li><li>You are at immediate risk of harming yourself or someone else.</li></ul><p>In these situations, peer support should not be treated as a substitute for professional or emergency care.</p></Section>

      <Section title="Can you use peer support and therapy together?"><p>Yes. They can serve different roles. A therapist can provide structured clinical work, while peer support can provide additional human connection between appointments or during everyday moments when someone wants to talk.</p><p>The important boundary is clarity: peer support should remain peer support, and clinical needs should be taken to appropriately qualified professionals.</p></Section>
