        <p className="lead">
          How Was Your Day connects Indian Americans and South Asians with real peer listeners who genuinely
          understand desi life — not from a textbook, not from training data, but from having actually
          lived it. Family expectations, identity stress, cultural duality, immigration anxiety — they
          get it because they have been there.

          <h2>The specific loneliness of being South Asian in America</h2>
          <p>
            Being Indian American means navigating two worlds that do not always understand each other.
            At home, your parents have expectations shaped by Indian culture. At work and with American
            friends, you operate in a completely different context. The translation between these two
            versions of yourself is exhausting — and not many people fully understand it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A therapist who has never experienced desi life can help with general anxiety. But a How Was Your Day
            listener who has actually lived the Indian-American experience understands the specific texture
            of your struggles. That difference matters.

          <p>
            You can explain desi culture to a therapist. Or you can talk to someone who already knows —
            who grew up in the same cultural ecosystem, navigated the same expectations, and came out
            the other side with genuine understanding.

          <p>
            How Was Your Day listeners with South Asian backgrounds are a request away — no appointment,
            no waitlist, no $250/hour. Just a real person who gets it.
