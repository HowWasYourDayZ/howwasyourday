          How Was Your Day is a peer support platform that connects people in the UK with real human listeners —
          people with lived experience, not AI chatbots. No NHS waiting list. No referral. No appointment.
          A real person, no appointment, from £8.

          <h2>Britain has a loneliness problem — and an NHS waiting list problem</h2>
          <p>
            The UK has a Minister for Loneliness. NHS mental health waiting times regularly exceed
            18 months for talking therapy. Private therapy starts at £60 a session. And in the
            meantime, people are quietly managing more than they should have to manage alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The British tendency — keep it together, don&apos;t make a fuss, sort it out yourself —
            doesn&apos;t help. Nor does talking to an AI that sounds empathetic but is not actually
            receiving you. What helps is a real human who listens without judgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            How Was Your Day gives you exactly that. A real peer listener, screened and reviewed, available any
            time of day or night, for £8 — less than a pint of lager in London.

          <h2>What How Was Your Day is — in plain English</h2>
          <p>
            How Was Your Day is a peer support platform. Every listener is a real human being who has applied,
            been reviewed, and chosen for how well they listen without judgment. They are not therapists or counsellors.
            They are not AI. They are real people — with lives, with their own experience of the hard
            things — who choose to be present for others.
          </p>
          <p>What you can expect from a How Was Your Day session:</p>
          <ul className="checklist" style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>
            <li>A real person — fully present, undivided attention, no scripts</li>
            <li>No advice unless you want it — just listening and space to be heard</li>
            <li>Complete anonymity — no name, no location, no identifying details required</li>
            <li>No appointment — listeners are in India, so availability follows Indian time</li>
            <li>No NHS referral, no GP appointment, no insurance — just a human who listens</li>
            <li>Sessions from 8 minutes — no credit card, no commitment required</li>
