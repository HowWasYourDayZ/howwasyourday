          <h2>The Problem with Mental Health Support in India</h2>

          <h3>When professional care is the right fit</h3>
          <p>If you need assessment, diagnosis, treatment, medication guidance or support with a mental-health condition, seek a qualified mental-health professional. Fees and wait times vary by clinician, service and location, so check directly with providers.</p>

          <h3>Peer support is a different option</h3>
          <p>If what you want is a non-clinical conversation and a chance to talk through everyday emotional stress, peer support may be one option alongside other care. It is not a substitute for professional assessment or treatment when those are needed.</p>

          <h3>Stigma Is Still Real</h3>
          <p>In many Indian families and workplaces, seeking mental health support — especially professional support — still carries stigma. The person who needs help often cannot tell the people around them that they are seeking it. They may prefer to talk outside their usual circle. On How Was Your Day, listeners do not see a user's phone number, and users can choose a display name; text messages are stored and authorised administrators may review reports or safety-flagged sessions.</p>

          <h3>When you specifically want a human conversation</h3>
          <p>Some people find AI tools useful for reflection; others prefer to talk with a person. How Was Your Day is for adults who want a human peer conversation. It does not claim to be better for everyone, and it does not replace professional care.</p>
        </div>

        {/* A different kind of support */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>A Different Kind of Support</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day is a peer support platform. Every listener on How Was Your Day is a real person who has lived through something relevant to the conversations they take. They are screened for active listening, supportive conversation, and knowing when to refer someone to professional help.</p>
          <p>This is not therapy. How Was Your Day does not diagnose or treat mental-health conditions. It may suit someone who wants a non-clinical conversation, but it is not a substitute for a qualified professional when clinical care is needed.</p>
