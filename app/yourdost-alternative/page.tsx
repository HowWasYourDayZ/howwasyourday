        <p className="lead">
          YourDOST does good work — but it is tied to your employer, runs on office hours, and can feel clinical
          when you just need to talk. How Was Your Day connects you with a real peer listener in under 2 minutes,
          privately, whenever a listener is online. No HR, no corporate portal, no waiting list.

          <h2>When YourDOST is not quite right for you</h2>
          <p>
            YourDOST is valuable as a corporate benefit — but it has limits that matter. Access disappears
            when you change jobs or your company&apos;s subscription lapses. Sessions are scheduled in advance
            and mostly happen during work hours. And because it is linked to your employer, there is always
            a quiet worry: <em>who can see this?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Many working professionals find themselves in a gap — they know they want support, but therapy
            feels too heavy, too expensive, or just not what they need right now. They want to talk to
            someone who actually gets it, quickly, without it going anywhere near their HR file.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is exactly the gap How Was Your Day was built for.

          <h2>Who uses How Was Your Day after YourDOST</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of the people who find How Was Your Day have used YourDOST before — and liked it, actually. But then
            something changed: they switched jobs, got laid off, started freelancing, or their company stopped
            the subscription. Suddenly the support they had relied on was gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others are still employed but want something they can reach at 11 PM after a rough day — not book
            for next Tuesday. Or they want to vent about work stress without even the smallest chance of it
            feeding back to their manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            How Was Your Day is not trying to replace YourDOST. It is the thing you reach for when YourDOST is not
            available, not affordable, or not private enough for the moment.
