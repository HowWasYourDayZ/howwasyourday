          <h2>Loneliness in India looks different than people think</h2>
          <p>We picture loneliness as someone alone in a room. But in India, it often looks like this:</p>
          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>A new city. A new job. Nobody your age in your building.</li>
            <li>A packed hostel where everyone seems to have their group already.</li>
            <li>A marriage that works on paper but feels hollow inside.</li>
            <li>Being surrounded by family who doesn&apos;t understand you.</li>
            <li>Scrolling Instagram at midnight because it&apos;s better than silence.</li>
            <li>A career going well but feeling completely empty about it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>All of these are real. All of these are enough reason to reach out.</p>

          <h2>How a conversation with a peer listener helps</h2>
          <p>Loneliness shrinks when someone genuinely listens. Not to solve your problems. Not to give you
            advice. Just to be present with you, hear you out, and make you feel less alone in your own head.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are screened and expected to do exactly this — to ask gentle questions, to reflect back what
            they hear, and to make you feel like you matter. Because you do.</p>
