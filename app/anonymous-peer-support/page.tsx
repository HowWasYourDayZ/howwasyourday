        <h1><span>Anonymous</span> Peer Support India — How Was Your Day</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          Talk to someone who understands — without sharing your identity. How Was Your Day is India&apos;s most private peer support platform, designed for a country where stigma is real and family privacy matters.
        </p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Why anonymous support matters in India</h2>
          <p>In India, mental health struggles carry real stigma. In joint families, walls are thin. In workplaces, vulnerability can cost you. In friend groups, gossip travels. Many people who desperately need to talk to someone feel they simply cannot — because the risk to their reputation, relationships, or career is too high.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day was built for this reality. You can join with just your phone number, use any first name you choose, and talk about anything without fear of judgment or disclosure. Your listener only knows your chosen first name. Nothing else.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>How the app protects your anonymity</h2>
          <div className="privacy-list">

              </div>

          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What can you talk about anonymously?</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners specialise in topics that people in India are most hesitant to discuss openly: loneliness in joint families, anxiety at work, career confusion and comparison, relationship struggles and breakups, grief and loss, student exam pressure, startup burnout, and simply feeling stuck.</p>
          <p>You can also just talk — about anything, or nothing specific. Sometimes the most valuable thing is simply having someone present who is not judging you.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Is anonymous support as effective?</h2>
          <p>Research on peer support consistently shows that anonymity actually improves openness and honesty. When people feel safe from judgment, they share more authentically — and that authenticity is what makes support effective. Many people find they can say things to an anonymous peer listener that they have never been able to say to anyone in their life.</p>

          <p>No name required. No judgment. Someone is online right now.</p>
