          <h1>Emotional wellness doesn&apos;t mean having it all together. <em>It means having someone to process with.</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Not a destination. Not a state of permanent calm. Emotional wellness is the ongoing practice of staying connected to what you feel — and having somewhere to bring it.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Emotional Wellness Actually Looks Like</h2>
          <p>Emotional wellness is not the absence of difficult emotions. It is the capacity to feel them, name them, and process them without being overwhelmed or shut down by them.</p>
          <p>In practice, it looks like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Noticing when something is affecting you, rather than numbing or distracting</li>
            <li>Being able to say what you actually feel — to yourself and, when it matters, to others</li>
            <li>Processing as you go rather than accumulating until things explode</li>
            <li>Having a place to bring the hard things before they become crises</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Regular peer conversations on How Was Your Day support all of this — not just in crisis moments, but as an ongoing practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Emotional Intelligence: The Practice</h2>
          <p>Emotional intelligence — the skill of naming what you feel, understanding why, and communicating it — is built through practice, not acquired through reading. Conversation is one of the most effective practice environments: when you articulate what you are feeling to someone who reflects it back without judgment, you build the vocabulary and the habit.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day peer sessions are not just support. They are practice. Every conversation where you say something true and feel heard is a small act of emotional fitness.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>How Was Your Day as a Wellness Practice</h2>
          <p>Most people use How Was Your Day in moments of acute stress. But the most effective use is regular — weekly or monthly check-ins that keep you emotionally current rather than waiting until you are overwhelmed.</p>
          <p>Think of it like exercise: occasional intense sessions are less effective than regular moderate ones. The same is true of emotional processing.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="cta-card">
          <h2>Start the Practice</h2>
