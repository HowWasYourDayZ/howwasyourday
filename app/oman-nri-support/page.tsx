          The Indian community in Oman — particularly from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh — is one of the largest in the Gulf. But the size of the community does not close the emotional gap that expat life creates. How Was Your Day is a screened peer listener who understands the specific weight of this life, available anonymously any hour of the day.

        <p style={{ color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 16 }}>
          There is a specific loneliness that comes with being an NRI in the Gulf: you are successful by every external measure, your family is proud, your friends back home assume you are living a good life — and you are still carrying something heavy that you cannot quite put into words or share with anyone around you.
        </p>
        <p style={{ color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 32 }}>
          The financial pressure is real. The distance from family is real. The isolation of not having anyone close enough to say the true thing to is real. How Was Your Day is designed for exactly this — not therapy, not a helpline, but a screened human listener who has lived something similar and will not minimise what you are carrying.
