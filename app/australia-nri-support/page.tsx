LeanOn listeners are not immigration lawyers, but they can listen without judgment and without needing the whole thing explained from the beginning. The emotional weight of that uncertainty is real, and having someone who gets it can help.',

          Moving to Australia is an achievement. It can also be exhausting, lonely, and nothing like what you imagined. The people back home think you are living the dream. The people around you in Australia are colleagues, not close friends. And the weight of building a life from scratch — while managing visa stress, missing family, and holding the gap between expectation and reality — can be very real.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 32 }}>
          LeanOn is a screened Indian peer listener — not a therapist, not a helpline — who has lived through something similar and is there to listen without judgment. Anonymous, available in your language, no appointment needed.

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.3rem', fontWeight: 700, marginBottom: 12 }}>What the Australian NRI Experience Actually Carries</h2>
        <p style={{ color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 16 }}>
          The PR timeline anxiety. The loneliness of weekends in a new city where you are professional but not close to anyone. The strain of long-distance with a partner or family in India. The particular isolation of being the person everyone back home thinks is doing brilliantly.
        </p>
        <p style={{ color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 32 }}>
          Most of this does not meet the threshold for clinical support. And most of it is too complicated to explain to the people around you in Australia, or too worrying to share with family back home. Peer support fills exactly this gap.
