  "h1": "Living abroad and need someone who understands the Indian context?",
  "intro": "You can build a good life abroad and still miss having someone who understands the family expectations, relationships, language, humour and history you came from. How Was Your Day gives Indians and South Asians abroad a private place to talk to a real peer listener.",
  "problemTitle": "Distance changes who you can call",
  "problem": [
    "When you live away from India, some conversations become harder. You may not want to worry your parents, involve friends in a relationship problem, or explain cultural context to someone who has never lived it.",
    "Peer support cannot replace family, friends or professional care. It can provide another human conversation when you want someone outside your immediate circle."
  ],
  "humanTitle": "Why cultural context can matter",
  "human": [
    "Shared context — A listener with relevant Indian or South Asian experience may understand family dynamics or cultural references without a long explanation.",
    "Distance — You can talk about homesickness and family back home without needing to turn a difficult moment into a call to relatives.",
    "Private space — You choose what to share and whether text or voice feels more comfortable.",
    "Everyday support — The topic can be work, dating, marriage, immigration stress, loneliness or simply missing home."

  "whyTitle": "Why How Was Your Day fits this moment",
  "why": [
    "How Was Your Day is built around one-to-one peer support. It is not positioned as therapy, counselling or an AI companion.",
    "You choose a listener rather than receiving a generic response. The goal is a human conversation where you can talk, vent, reflect or simply not feel alone for a while.",
    "You can start without committing to a long programme: sessions start at 8 minutes, followed by paid time only if you choose to continue."
  ],
  "fitTitle": "Indians abroad may look for a conversation about…",
  "fit": [
    "Homesickness and missing parents or siblings.",
    "Marriage, dating or family expectations across countries.",
    "Work, study, relocation or immigration uncertainty.",
    "Feeling culturally isolated even when daily life looks busy.",
    "A breakup or relationship problem you do not want to discuss with family.",
    "The ordinary emotional weight of living far from home."

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Can Indians outside India use How Was Your Day?",
      "a": "Yes. How Was Your Day has a dedicated Indian diaspora support experience for Indians and South Asians living abroad."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I talk about homesickness?",
      "a": "Yes. Homesickness, family distance and cultural adjustment are appropriate peer-support topics."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I try How Was Your Day before paying?",
      "a": "Yes. New seekers can start with an 8-minute session."
    },
    {
      "q": "When are listeners online if I live abroad?",
      "a": "Listeners are in India and choose their own hours, so availability follows Indian time (IST). Evenings in the Gulf, Singapore and Malaysia overlap Indian evenings, when most listeners are online. UK evenings are late night in India, and US or Canadian evenings fall in the Indian morning, so fewer listeners may be online then. Browse shows who is online right now."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I talk in Hindi or another Indian language?",
      "a": "Each listener's profile shows the languages they speak, and you choose who to request. Hindi and English are the most common; other Indian languages depend on which listeners are online."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much does it cost outside India, and how am I charged?",
      "a": "Outside India a 15-minute session is from US$10 (30 minutes from US$15, 45 minutes from US$20), shown in your local currency where available. You top up a How Was Your Day wallet and are charged in Indian rupees, so your card needs international payments enabled. You are charged only if a listener accepts, unused minutes return to your wallet, and unused balance is refundable on request."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which countries can sign in?",
      "a": "You sign in with a one-time code sent to your mobile number. Supported countries include the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Singapore and Malaysia."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will a listener definitely be available?",
      "a": "Not always. A session starts only when an available listener accepts your request. If nobody can, you are not charged, and you can leave a listener a message from their profile."
