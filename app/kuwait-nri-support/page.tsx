          Life in Kuwait has a particular weight to it — long working hours, distance from family, the pressure of being the one who is "settled abroad," and a loneliness that can be hard to name when you are surrounded by people. How Was Your Day gives you a screened Indian peer listener who understands this from the inside. Anonymous, available any hour, in your language.

        <p style={{ color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 24 }}>
          There is an unspoken rule in many Indian expat communities: you are supposed to be grateful. You left India, you are earning well by comparison, your family is proud. Admitting that you are lonely, or anxious, or that something is deeply wrong — that can feel like ingratitude. So most people say nothing.
        </p>
        <p style={{ color: '#444', lineHeight: 1.7, marginBottom: 32 }}>
          How Was Your Day is built for exactly this. A private conversation with someone who has lived something similar and will not minimise what you are carrying. The Gulf community — particularly the Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh diaspora in Kuwait — is large, but the emotional support infrastructure within it is nearly invisible. This is an attempt to change that.
