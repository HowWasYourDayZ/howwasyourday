      name: 'What is online venting and does it work?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Online venting means expressing what is frustrating, upsetting or overwhelming you to another person through text or voice. Some people find it helpful to put thoughts into words and feel heard, although it does not solve every problem or replace professional care when that is needed. How Was Your Day connects people with screened peer listeners for everyday emotional support, not clinical treatment.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Why vent to a stranger online instead of a friend?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'A listener is outside your family, workplace and friend group, which can make it easier to talk about a sensitive situation. How Was Your Day listeners are screened peers who aim to listen without judgment. You can use a display name, but sign-in still requires a phone number; read the Privacy Policy and avoid sharing details you are not comfortable disclosing.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Is venting online in India safe and private?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'How Was Your Day uses phone OTP for sign-in, but your phone number is not shown to listeners; you can use a display name. Voice calls are not recorded. Text messages are stored securely and only authorised How Was Your Day administrators can open them, for example to review a reported or safety-flagged session. Review the Privacy Policy for details and avoid sharing identifying details you do not want to disclose.' },

    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What should I say when I start a venting session?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Whatever is there. You can open with \'Something just happened and I need to get it out\' or \'I\'ve been holding something since this morning\' or literally just start talking. You do not need to have it organised or summarised. The listener\'s job is to receive whatever comes out.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'How long should a vent session be?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Most people find 15 minutes is enough to feel meaningfully lighter. The first few minutes are often just getting it out — the whole thing, unedited. The last few minutes are the shift: once it is out, something changes. 30 minutes is better if there is a lot or if you want to actually talk through it rather than just express it.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'What makes How Was Your Day different from just texting a friend to vent?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Three things: confidentiality (your listener has no connection to your life and no interest in sharing what you say), no social debt (you are not creating a situation where someone now worries about you, has an opinion, or expects an update), and practised presence (listeners are practised in actually receiving what you say without redirecting, one-upping, or immediately solving).' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'How much does a vent session cost on How Was Your Day?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'One introductory session of up to 5 minutes is free per account. In India, paid sessions are priced at the selected listener’s per-minute rate multiplied by the duration, plus a flat ₹10 platform fee. For example, 15 minutes at ₹10/min costs ₹160. The exact price is shown before you start; see https://www.howwasyourday.live/pricing.' },
    },
    {
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: 'Can I talk to someone immediately?',
      acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'You can browse the live listener directory and send a request to someone shown as available. A conversation starts when the listener accepts; immediate availability is not guaranteed and can change throughout the day.' },

          <h2>The Problem With Venting to People You Know</h2>
          <p>The moment you tell a friend something difficult, you have taken on a second job: managing their reaction. They worry. They have opinions. They may share it with someone else. They might say something that makes you regret telling them. They will bring it up again later at a moment you do not expect.</p>
          <p>Even the best people in your life are not clean receivers. They are filters — their own histories, biases, and emotional investments shape what they hear and how they respond. Sometimes that is valuable. Often, when you just need to get something out, it is an obstacle.</p>
          <p>A peer listener on How Was Your Day has no connection to your life. No stake in the outcome. No opinion about who is right. No risk of it going further. That is a different kind of space — and sometimes it is exactly the kind you need.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Actually Happens When You Vent to a Listener</h2>
          <p>Putting a problem into words can help some people organise what happened and decide what they need next. Other times, you may simply want someone to hear you before you decide what to do. Responses differ from person to person, and venting is not a treatment or a guarantee that distress will go away.</p>
          <p>A How Was Your Day peer listener offers a focused human conversation. You can explain the situation in your own words, ask to be heard without advice, or think aloud about what might help. If you need clinical assessment or treatment, a qualified mental health professional is the right support.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What You Can Say</h2>
          <p>There is no category of thing too small, too messy, or too complicated. These are the kinds of things people bring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;My in-laws have been making comments and I can&apos;t say anything back&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;I&apos;m furious at my boss and can&apos;t show it&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;My partner and I had a fight and I&apos;m still shaking&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;I got rejected and nobody in my life knows I even applied&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Something is building and I need to release it before it comes out the wrong way&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;I&apos;ve been holding something for days and I just need to say it to someone&rdquo;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You do not need to organise it. You do not need to know what you want from the conversation. Just start talking.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What the Listener Will and Won&apos;t Do</h2>
          <h3>What they will do</h3>
          <p>Listen without interrupting. Reflect back what they hear so you feel received. Stay with you through the uncomfortable parts without flinching. Follow your lead on what you need — more space, a question, a reflection.</p>
          <h3>What they will not do</h3>
          <p>They will not give you unsolicited advice. They will not tell you what you should have done. They will not judge the person you are venting about, or build a case against them, or accidentally take sides. They are expected to respect the privacy of the session. Read our <a href="/privacy" style={{color:'var(--teal)',fontWeight:700}}>Privacy Policy</a> for how platform data and safety moderation work. They will not bring their own problems into it. They are there entirely for you — and that is the whole job.</p>
