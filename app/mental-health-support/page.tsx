  ['Should I choose peer support or counselling?', 'If you need professional assessment or structured therapeutic care, seek a qualified counsellor, psychologist or other appropriate professional. If you mainly want human connection and someone to listen, peer support may be relevant.'],

  ['What is mental health support?', 'Mental health support is broader than therapy. It can mean having a trusted person listen, joining a peer community, speaking with a counsellor, working with a psychologist, or receiving psychiatric care when clinically appropriate. The right level depends on what someone is experiencing and what kind of help they need.'],
  ['Peer support, counselling and clinical care are different', 'Peer support focuses on listening, connection, empathy and shared experience. Counselling and psychotherapy are professional services delivered by appropriately qualified practitioners and may involve structured therapeutic work. Psychiatry is medical care that can include diagnosis and medication. These categories should be kept distinct rather than blurred for marketing.'],
  ['When a human peer conversation may be useful', 'Sometimes the immediate need is simple: say something out loud, have another person listen, get perspective from someone who understands, or avoid spending another difficult evening alone with your thoughts. LeanOn is designed for this non-clinical use case.', ['Loneliness or feeling disconnected','Relationship, family or marriage stress','Work pressure, burnout or career uncertainty','Breakups, grief and difficult transitions','Overthinking or a difficult day','Homesickness or living away from family','Wanting someone to listen without changing an existing relationship']],
  ['When professional mental health care matters', 'If you are experiencing persistent or severe symptoms, significant impairment, thoughts of self-harm, suicidal intent, psychosis, mania or another urgent mental health concern, peer support is not the appropriate level of care. Contact a qualified professional or local emergency/crisis service.'],
  ['Human support in a digital world', 'AI tools can be useful for information, reflection and many everyday tasks. But some people specifically want another human being who can listen, respond in real time and bring lived experience to a conversation. LeanOn is a complementary option for that human-to-human need, not a claim that AI is unsuitable for every use case.'],
