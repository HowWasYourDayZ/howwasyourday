          How Was Your Day is a peer support platform that connects people with real human listeners — people with
          genuine lived experience of loneliness, grief, relationships, and life&apos;s hardest moments.
          Unlike AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, How Was Your Day listeners are real humans who are actually
          present in the conversation with you.

          <h2>What AI cannot give you</h2>
          <p>
            ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AI chatbots can generate empathetic-sounding words. But there are
            things they fundamentally cannot provide, no matter how sophisticated they become:
          </p>
          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>Genuine understanding — knowing what something feels like because you&apos;ve been there</li>
            <li>Real presence — another consciousness that is actually with you in this moment</li>
            <li>True connection — the feeling of being received by someone who cares</li>
            <li>Authentic empathy — not predicted empathy, but empathy from lived experience</li>
            <li>The relief of being truly heard — not processed, not analysed, but actually heard</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>
            Research on loneliness is clear: the relief comes from genuine human connection. AI can
            simulate conversation. It cannot simulate presence.

          <h2>What real human support provides</h2>
          <p>
            A How Was Your Day listener brings their whole self to a conversation. They have been through things —
            real things. A difficult relationship. Loss. Periods of not knowing who they were. Career
            uncertainty. Family tension that didn&apos;t resolve neatly.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you talk to them, you are not talking to a system. You are talking to a person who has
            navigated their own version of what you are going through. That is what makes the difference.
          </p>
          <p>What every How Was Your Day session provides:</p>
          <ul className="checklist" style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>
            <li>A real human who is fully present and undistracted</li>
            <li>Genuine listening — not waiting to respond, but actually absorbing what you say</li>
            <li>Questions that come from real curiosity, not scripted prompts</li>
            <li>The kind of understanding that only comes from having felt similar things</li>
            <li>Complete anonymity — no names, no identifying information required</li>
