How Was Your Day is peer support — not for mental health emergencies, but for the everyday emotional weight that does not quite meet a clinical threshold but is still real: loneliness, homesickness, relationship problems, the exhaustion of starting over in a new country. There is no waitlist and no clinical notes.',

          Australia has a large and growing Indian community — Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth. The professional opportunities are real. So is the loneliness that can set in when the excitement of the move wears off and you realise the people who actually know you are ten thousand kilometres away. How Was Your Day gives you a real Indian peer listener who understands this from the inside. Private, in your language, with no appointment (availability follows Indian time).
