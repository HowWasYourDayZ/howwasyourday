          <h1>Fairfax, Ashburn, Herndon. <em>Little India. Big silence.</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">The Northern Virginia corridor — Fairfax, Ashburn, Herndon, Reston — is sometimes called &ldquo;Little India.&rdquo; Bethesda, Rockville, and Silver Spring hold some of the most accomplished Indian families in America. Living near power shapes you. The diplomatic distance, the high-stakes careers, the community that is too visible to be vulnerable in. Talk to someone outside all of it. First 5 minutes free.</p>
          <a href="https://www.howwasyourday.live/browse" className="cta-hero">Talk to someone now &rarr;</a>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Fairfax, Ashburn, Herndon: The Indian DMV</h2>
          <p>No Indian community in America is more concentrated in a single corridor than Northern Virginia. Fairfax County alone has one of the largest Indian populations of any county in the country. Ashburn and Herndon — where data centres sit alongside Indian grocery stores — are places where you can go days without speaking to anyone who isn&rsquo;t Indian or working in tech. The Silver Line was practically built for the Indian commuter.</p>
          <p>On the Maryland side, Rockville and Bethesda carry a significant Indian professional and medical community — the NIH, FEMA, and government contractor world has drawn Indian professionals for decades. Gaithersburg, Germantown, and the I-270 corridor have large Indian family communities. The DMV Indian community is one of the most established, credentialed, and quietly burdened in America.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are based in India, understand the NRI experience deeply, and are available without appointment. First 5 minutes free. From US$10.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>The Diplomatic Distance: Living Near Power, Feeling Far from Yourself</h2>
          <p>Working in or around government — policy, defence contracting, the World Bank, the IMF, embassy work, Capitol Hill staffing — has a particular effect on people. You become practiced at discretion. You learn to separate your professional face from your personal one. Vulnerability becomes professionally dangerous. And after years of this, the ability to simply say what you feel to another person atrophies.</p>
          <p>The DC Indian community carries this in a concentrated form. High-achieving, high-visibility, often in careers where the wrong thing said to the wrong person has real consequences. The Indian parent who is a senior official at a federal agency and has not told anyone — not even their spouse — how much they dread Monday mornings. The government contractor on a security clearance who has been managing a low-grade anxiety for three years and has told no one.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day is outside your professional network entirely. Anonymous. No notes that can be subpoenaed. A real Indian peer listener who understands the weight of the DMV Indian professional world.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>The Community That Sees Everything</h2>
          <p>The Northern Virginia Indian community is famously tight-knit. The temple committees, the cultural associations, the Diwali galas at the Marriott, the school parent networks where the Indian parents all know each other — it is a warm and supportive community, and it is one where news travels fast. You can be surrounded by hundreds of Indians every weekend and have no one you can actually talk to, because everyone knows your family, your career, your parents back in India.</p>
          <p>This is why How Was Your Day exists. Not a replacement for community — but a space outside it. A screened Indian peer listener who knows nothing about your career, your family, or your standing in the Fairfax Indian community. Someone who will just listen. Washington DC (EST) is 10.5 hours behind IST. 8am in DC is 6:30pm in India — before the commute, listeners are available.</p>
