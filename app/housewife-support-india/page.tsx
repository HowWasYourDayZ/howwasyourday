const directQuestion = "I'm a homemaker in India and feel lonely — where can I talk to someone?"
const directAnswer = "How Was Your Day lets adults in India request a one-to-one text or voice conversation with a screened peer listener about isolation, marital stress or the emotional load of homemaking. This is non-clinical peer support, not therapy. One introductory session of up to five minutes is free per account; paid prices and availability vary."

Loneliness may be related to limited adult interaction, invisible household labour or the pressure of ongoing caregiving; experiences vary, and loneliness alone does not mean someone has depression or an anxiety disorder. What you feel is real and widely shared.' },

If you are experiencing persistent low mood, inability to feel pleasure, significant changes in sleep or appetite, or thoughts of self-harm, please speak to a doctor. For the everyday weight of homemaker life &mdash; the invisible exhaustion, the identity questions, the loneliness &mdash; peer support is appropriate and helpful.' },

          <h2>The Invisible Exhaustion of Being a Homemaker</h2>
          <p>The work of running a home and managing a family does not end. There is no clock-out. There is no commute home where the day stops. There is no performance review that acknowledges the thousand things managed invisibly. The labour is real &mdash; physical, emotional, logistical &mdash; and it is almost entirely uncounted.</p>
          <p>The emotional labour component is particularly draining. Managing the emotional temperature of the household. Absorbing the stress that comes in from outside. Being the person everyone brings their problems to without having a person to bring yours to. This is not invisible to you. It is simply invisible to everyone around you.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>The Specific Loneliness of Homemaker Life</h2>
          <p>Adult conversation deficit is real. Most of your day is spent with children, household tasks, and the occasional errand. The conversations you have are not the kind that fill the adult part of you &mdash; the part that has thoughts and opinions and a perspective on the world beyond the domestic sphere.</p>
          <p>The comparison with working women can feel acute, even when you do not intend it. They have colleagues. They leave the house. They have a professional identity. This is not to say working is better or worse than homemaking &mdash; it is to acknowledge that homemaking involves specific losses that are rarely named, and the loneliness that results is real and deserves support.</p>
          <p>In joint families, the dynamic is more complex. You may be surrounded by people all day and still fundamentally alone in your inner life &mdash; because the family structure does not create space for individual emotional needs, especially for the woman who is there to maintain the household.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Why Homemakers in India Hesitate to Seek Support</h2>
          <p>Three things stop most homemakers from reaching out:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;Others have it worse.&rdquo; The comparison logic that says your struggle is not legitimate because it is not extreme enough.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;My husband provides.&rdquo; The financial dependency frame that conflates being provided for with having your emotional needs met. These are separate things.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;What would people think?&rdquo; The social risk of being seen to struggle &mdash; which might be interpreted as ingratitude or instability by family and community.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>None of these are reasons not to seek support. They are reasons to seek it anonymously.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What How Was Your Day Offers</h2>
          <p>A space that is entirely yours. Where you are not a wife or a mother or a daughter-in-law. Just a person, with thoughts and feelings and a need to be heard. The listener has no connection to your family. Nothing you say will reach them. You can say everything you manage in silence every day &mdash; and be heard by someone who has no agenda except to understand.</p>
          <p>Sessions are 15 minutes. You can find 15 minutes. During school drop-off. While the lunch is on the stove. After everyone has gone to bed. This is not a major commitment &mdash; it is a small space that is entirely yours.</p>
