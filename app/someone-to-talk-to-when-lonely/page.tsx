  "intro": "Loneliness does not always mean you have nobody around. Sometimes it means you want one person who will actually listen. LeanOn gives you a private way to start that human conversation.",
  "problemTitle": "You can be surrounded by people and still feel alone",
  "problem": [
    "You can have a partner, family, colleagues and a full contact list and still reach a moment when you do not know who you can honestly talk to. Loneliness is often about the quality of connection, not simply the number of people around you.",
    "If you want company, a place to vent or someone who will listen without needing anything from you, a one-to-one peer conversation is one option."

    "Reciprocity — A conversation happens between two people, with a real person responding to what you say.",
    "Attention — You can focus on one conversation instead of trying to perform being okay for a whole social group.",
    "Shared experience — You can choose a listener whose profile includes experiences relevant to yours.",
    "Connection without social history — Sometimes a person outside your everyday circle is easier to talk to."

  "why": [
    "LeanOn is built around one-to-one peer support. It is not positioned as therapy, counselling or an AI companion.",
    "You choose a listener rather than receiving a generic response. The goal is a human conversation where you can talk, vent, reflect or simply not feel alone for a while.",
    "You can start without committing to a long programme: one free 5-minute introduction is available per account, followed by paid time only if you choose to continue."

  "fitTitle": "A conversation may be useful when…",
  "fit": [
    "You are alone at home and want another human voice or chat.",
    "You have people around you but nobody you want to tell the whole story to.",
    "You moved cities or countries and miss familiar connection.",
    "You are going through a breakup or relationship distance.",
    "You want to talk without worrying that you are burdening a friend.",
    "You simply want company for a difficult stretch."
