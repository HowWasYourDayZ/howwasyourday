const QA_Q = 'I am in therapy or on a waiting list — can I talk to someone in between?'
const QA_A = 'Yes. Many people use How Was Your Day between therapy sessions, late at night when their therapist is not available, or while they wait for a first appointment. You talk privately, by text or voice, with a screened peer listener in India who listens without judging. Keep your doctor or therapist: How Was Your Day listeners never advise on diagnosis or medication. Your first 5 minutes are free.'

const faqs = [
  { q: 'Can I use How Was Your Day if I have depression, anxiety or another diagnosis?', a: 'Yes, as long as you keep your professional care. A peer listener can be someone to talk to about your day, your worries or how you are coping. They are not clinicians: they will not diagnose you, change your treatment or tell you what medication to take. Share only what you are comfortable sharing.' },
  { q: 'Can a listener tell me whether to change or stop my medication?', a: 'No — and they will not try. Only your psychiatrist or doctor should decide anything about medication. If something about your treatment worries you, write it down and take it to them.' },
  { q: 'I am on a waiting list for therapy. Is it okay to talk to someone meanwhile?', a: 'Yes. Waiting can be hard, and talking to someone who listens can make it more bearable. If things get worse while you wait — especially thoughts of harming yourself — text SHOUT to 85258 (free, 24/7) or Samaritans 116 123, and contact the service you are waiting for.' },
  { q: 'Should I tell my therapist I use How Was Your Day?', a: 'It is up to you, but many therapists welcome knowing what helps you between sessions. You can bring anything that came up in a How Was Your Day conversation into therapy.' },
  { q: 'What is the difference between a peer listener and my therapist?', a: 'Your therapist is a trained professional who assesses and treats. A peer listener is an ordinary adult with lived experience who listens — no treatment plan, no diagnosis. Peer support can sit alongside therapy, but it does not replace it.' },
  { q: 'Is it private?', a: 'The listener sees only the name you choose, never your phone number. Voice calls are not recorded. Text messages are stored securely and only authorised How Was Your Day administrators can open them, for example to review a reported or safety-flagged session.' },
