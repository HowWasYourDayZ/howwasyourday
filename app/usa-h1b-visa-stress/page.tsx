          For most people, a layoff is stressful. For H-1B holders, it is an existential threat. Your apartment,
          your friends, your years of building a life in the USA — all of it tied to a single employer. That is
          an enormous psychological burden that most people around you will never understand.

          <h2>The specific weight of H-1B anxiety</h2>
          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>Every layoff news cycle sends a wave of dread through your body that your American colleagues do not feel.</li>
            <li>You perform well, smile, stay late — partly because you are good, partly because you cannot afford to be seen as disposable.</li>
            <li>The 60-day grace period clock ticking in the back of your mind, even when things are fine.</li>
            <li>Dependent family members whose visa status is also tied to yours.</li>
            <li>Years on the green card queue — and the fear of what losing this job means for that timeline.</li>

          <h2>😔 The limbo is its own kind of suffering</h2>
          <p>Even when nothing bad has happened yet, the permanent awareness that it could — at any moment,
            for any reason — is exhausting. You cannot fully relax. You cannot make long-term plans.
            You cannot stop monitoring the news.</p>
          <p>A How Was Your Day listener will not fix the visa situation. But they will give you a space to say all
            of this out loud to someone who already understands what is actually at stake.</p>

        <div className="card">
          <h2>Why your usual support system does not help enough</h2>
          <p>Your American colleagues think visa concerns are just &quot;paperwork stress.&quot; Your family in
            India worries and adds to the pressure rather than relieving it. Your partner is going through
            the same anxiety so you try not to pile on.</p>
          <p>A How Was Your Day listener is a neutral, confidential space. They understand the H-1B system without
            needing it explained. They will sit with you in the uncertainty without minimising it or
            catastrophising it.</p>
          <p>Sessions start at <strong>$10 for 15 minutes</strong> — your first 5-minute session free.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="card">
          <h2>It is okay to not be okay about this</h2>
          <p>The culture around H-1B workers rewards stoicism. You are supposed to be grateful, adaptable,
            not-a-burden. There is very little space to say: this is genuinely terrifying and I am not
            handling it as well as I look.</p>
          <p>You are handling an objectively stressful situation. The dread you feel is a rational
            response to real structural precarity — not a weakness, not an overreaction. It deserves
            to be acknowledged.</p>
