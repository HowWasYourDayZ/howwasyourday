          <h1>Peer Support in Delhi — Someone to Lean On in <em>the Capital</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Delhi is a city of enormous ambition and equally enormous expectations — on your career, your family obligations, your relationships, and your very identity. How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners who understand the specific weight of living in India's capital, and how to carry it without breaking.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Delhi's pressures */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Delhi's Emotional Pressures</h2>
          <p>Every city has its own flavour of emotional difficulty. Delhi's is a particular mix: high stakes, deep social hierarchies, intense family structures, and a culture that glorifies strength while pathologising vulnerability.</p>

          <h3>Career Expectations in the Capital</h3>
          <p>Delhi attracts people with big ambitions — government careers, corporate leadership, media, defence, academia. Being in the capital means the stakes always feel higher, the competition more fierce, and the social consequences of not achieving more visible. There is a relentless pressure to have the right credentials, the right position, the right trajectory. Many people in Delhi achieve a great deal externally while privately feeling lost, unfulfilled, or like they are running someone else's race.</p>

          <h3>Family Obligations and Expectations</h3>
          <p>Delhi's family structures carry enormous weight. Expectations around marriage timelines, career choices, living arrangements, and social obligations are often non-negotiable. Many people — especially those in their mid-to-late twenties and thirties — describe the exhausting experience of managing dual lives: their authentic inner world and the version of themselves their family expects to see. This performance is deeply lonely, even when you are surrounded by people who love you.</p>

          <h3>Relationship Dynamics Under Pressure</h3>
          <p>Relationships in Delhi are complicated by class dynamics, family approval, gender expectations, and the very real financial calculations of building a life in an expensive city. Many people struggle with the gap between the relationship they want and the relationship that is "acceptable." Others are in relationships that look fine from the outside but feel lonely or disconnected from the inside. Peer support gives you a private space to talk through what is actually happening — without family advice or social judgment.</p>

          <h3>The Weight of Ambition</h3>
          <p>Delhi runs on ambition — and ambition, sustained for years without emotional support, is exhausting. The hustle culture here is different from Bengaluru's startup scene: it is older, more status-driven, more hierarchical. Many Delhiites describe a specific kind of tiredness that comes not from failure but from succeeding in ways that do not actually feel good. That quiet disillusionment deserves to be spoken out loud.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Men's mental health */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Men's Mental Health in Delhi</h2>
          <p>Delhi's masculine culture makes emotional expression particularly difficult for men. The expectation to be strong, decisive, and unaffected is deeply embedded — in families, workplaces, and social circles. Men are expected to provide, to lead, and to cope — silently, if necessary.</p>

          <h3>The Cost of Silence</h3>
          <p>This expectation of stoicism has real consequences. Men in Delhi often carry relationship stress, career anxiety, family pressure, and identity confusion with no outlet — because talking about feelings has been socially coded as weakness. Over time, this suppression manifests as irritability, withdrawal, physical health problems, and relationship breakdown.</p>

          <h3>A Private Space to Be Honest</h3>
          <p>How Was Your Day offers something genuinely rare for men in Delhi: a completely private, judgment-free space to say what you are actually feeling. No one in your social or professional network will know. No one will think less of you. Many male users describe their first How Was Your Day session as the first time they have ever been honest about how they are really doing — and the relief that brings.</p>

          <h3>Peer Listeners Who Understand</h3>
          <p>Several of our male listeners have themselves navigated Delhi's particular version of masculine pressure — the expectation to suppress, achieve, and never ask for help. They understand the dynamic from the inside, which makes the conversation feel different from therapy or advice.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Women's loneliness */}
        <div className="section">
          <h2>Women's Loneliness in Delhi</h2>
          <p>For women in Delhi, loneliness often has a specific quality: the loneliness of having to perform a version of yourself that is acceptable, while your actual thoughts, desires, and struggles remain unspoken.</p>

          <h3>Social Monitoring and Its Costs</h3>
          <p>Many women in Delhi navigate intense social monitoring — from family, neighbours, extended relatives, and social circles. What you wear, who you spend time with, how ambitious you are, when you marry, what you say publicly — all of it is observed and commented on. The result is a kind of self-censorship that, over years, can create a profound disconnection from your own inner life. You forget what you actually think because you have spent so long managing what other people think of you.</p>

          <h3>Professional Success and Personal Loneliness</h3>
          <p>Delhi has a significant population of highly educated, professionally successful women — many of whom describe feeling profoundly alone. Their professional peers are colleagues, not confidants. Their family members do not understand their world. Their friends are navigating their own impossible pressures. The result is a loneliness that is hard to name because externally, everything looks fine.</p>

          <h3>A Space to Be Fully Honest</h3>
          <p>How Was Your Day's female listeners have navigated their own versions of this experience — the pressure to be appropriate, the loneliness of performed happiness, the exhaustion of managing family expectations while also building a career and a self. Talking to someone who understands that particular texture of experience makes a real difference.</p>
