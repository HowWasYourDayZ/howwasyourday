Many young Kolkatans face the painful choice between leaving for opportunities elsewhere and staying close to ageing parents.

          <h1>Peer Support in Kolkata — Someone to Lean On, in <em>Bangla or English</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Kolkata is a city that talks — adda, politics, poetry, football. But the conversation that matters most, the one about how you are actually doing, is often the hardest to start. How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners who understand — in Bengali, Hindi, or English.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Kolkata&apos;s Emotional Landscape</h2>
          <p>Kolkata&apos;s emotional life is rich and complicated. A city of immense intellectual tradition where everyone has opinions about everything — except, somehow, their own inner weather.</p>

          <h3>The Stay-or-Leave Dilemma</h3>
          <p>Few cities force the question as sharply as Kolkata: stay close to family and accept fewer opportunities, or leave for Bengaluru, Mumbai, or abroad and carry the guilt of distance. Those who stay often wrestle with career frustration and the quiet feeling of being left behind. Those who leave call home every Sunday and feel the ache anyway. Both deserve a space to talk about it honestly.</p>

          <h3>The Weight of Expectations in a City of Intellect</h3>
          <p>Kolkata reveres achievement — academic brilliance, artistic talent, professional respectability. For students at Presidency or Jadavpur, for first-generation professionals in Salt Lake&apos;s IT sector, the pressure to live up to the family&apos;s intellectual legacy can be immense. Falling short, or simply choosing a different path, often cannot be discussed at home.</p>

          <h3>Everyone Knows Everyone</h3>
          <p>The para, the extended family, the neighbourhood network — Kolkata&apos;s social fabric is warm, but it is also watchful. Personal struggles become community discussion fast. That is precisely why anonymous peer support matters here: a conversation that stays between you and your listener, with no chance of reaching your para.</p>

          <h3>The Mother-Tongue Difference</h3>
          <p>Some feelings only have words in Bangla. How Was Your Day has listeners who speak Bengali, so the conversation can happen in the language your heart actually uses.</p>

          <h2>Who Uses How Was Your Day in Kolkata</h2>
          <h3>Young Professionals at a Crossroads</h3>
          <p>Whether you are weighing an offer in another city, stuck in a job that pays less than your potential, or supporting parents while building your own life — these are heavy decisions that benefit from a thinking-out-loud conversation with someone neutral.</p>

          <h3>Students Under Academic Pressure</h3>
          <p>Kolkata&apos;s academic culture is demanding, and the comparison to cousins, neighbours, and batchmates never stops. Students use How Was Your Day when the pressure feels unspeakable at home.</p>

          <h3>Anyone Carrying Quiet Loneliness</h3>
          <p>In a city famous for conversation, admitting loneliness feels almost contradictory. It is not. It is human — and it is exactly what peer listeners understand.</p>
