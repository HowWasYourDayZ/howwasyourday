            just heard.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day connects you with screened peer listeners who are expected to listen without judgement. They are not therapists, and they do not provide professional relationship counselling or decide what you should do.</p>

          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are screened and expected to be neutral. They have no stake in the outcome. Their only job is
            to help you feel heard — and that changes everything.</p>
