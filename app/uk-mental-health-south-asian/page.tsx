        <p className="lead">
          In many South Asian families, talking about how you really feel is not an option. You push through.
          You do not burden others. You are fine. But being fine all the time takes a toll — and somewhere
          between the British weather, the distance from home, and the pressure to succeed, that toll adds up.

            <h3>Why is mental health so stigmatised in South Asian communities?</h3>
            <p>In many South Asian families, emotional struggles are seen as weakness — something to push
              through. Seeking help can feel like bringing shame on the family. This stigma is slowly

            <h3>Is How Was Your Day a substitute for therapy?</h3>
            <p>No. How Was Your Day is peer support — not therapy. Think of it as support from a wise, caring person
