          <h1>Peer Support in Pune — For a City of <em>Students and New Starts</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Pune is where India comes to begin: first college, first job, first time living away from home. It is also where loneliness quietly peaks — surrounded by lakhs of people your age, yet with no one who truly knows you. How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners who have lived exactly that.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Pune&apos;s Emotional Landscape</h2>
          <p>Pune wears many identities — Oxford of the East, IT hub, cultural capital of Maharashtra — and each one carries its own emotional weight.</p>

          <h3>The Student City&apos;s Hidden Loneliness</h3>
          <p>Hundreds of thousands of students move to Pune every year for engineering, medicine, design, and management. They leave behind home food, mother tongues, and the people who knew them their whole lives. Hostel rooms and PGs are crowded, but real connection takes years. Exam pressure, placement anxiety, and the fear of disappointing parents back home pile on top. Many students describe 2 AM as the loneliest hour — which is exactly when How Was Your Day listeners are still available.</p>

          <h3>First Jobs, First Burnout</h3>
          <p>Pune&apos;s IT belt — Hinjewadi, Magarpatta, Kharadi — runs on young professionals in their first decade of work. Long commutes, project pressure, appraisal cycles, layoff news, and the strange isolation of moving to a new city for a job. Many earn well, send money home, and still feel empty in ways they can&apos;t explain to their families.</p>

          <h3>Between Two Cultures</h3>
          <p>Pune&apos;s deep Marathi cultural roots coexist with a massive migrant population. For locals, family expectations around career and marriage remain strong. For migrants, there is the constant subtle effort of belonging somewhere new. Both kinds of pressure deserve a listening ear — in Marathi, Hindi, or English.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Who Uses How Was Your Day in Pune</h2>
          <h3>Students Before Exams and Placements</h3>
          <p>The pressure of competitive exams and placement season is intense and isolating. Talking to a listener who has been through it — and come out the other side — brings perspective no coaching class provides.</p>

          <h3>Young Professionals Far From Home</h3>
          <p>When the workday ends and the flat is quiet, the distance from home feels longest. How Was Your Day listeners are available for a 15-minute conversation whenever the silence gets loud.</p>

          <h3>Anyone Navigating a New Beginning</h3>
          <p>New city, new job, new relationship, new breakup. Pune is a city of transitions, and transitions are exactly when having someone to lean on matters most.</p>
