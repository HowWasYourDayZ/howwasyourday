  ['Do I need therapy or someone to talk to?', 'It depends on what you are looking for. If you want diagnosis, assessment or treatment for a mental-health condition, speak with a qualified mental-health professional. If you mainly want a human conversation, someone to listen, or support with everyday loneliness, stress, relationships or a difficult week, peer support may be an option.'],
  ['What is the difference between therapy and peer support?', 'Therapy is clinical care delivered by a qualified professional and can involve assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Peer support is non-clinical support from someone with relevant lived experience who is screened and expected to listen and support without diagnosing or treating.'],
  ['Is counselling the same as peer support?', 'No. Counselling may refer to professional mental-health support provided by a qualified counsellor. Peer support is non-clinical and based on lived experience, listening and mutual understanding.'],
  ['Can I talk to someone instead of therapy?', 'If what you need is ordinary human connection or a place to talk through everyday emotional stress, you can choose peer support. But peer support should not be used as a substitute for professional care when you need clinical assessment or treatment.'],
  ['What if I do not want therapy but need support?', 'You can explore non-clinical options such as talking with trusted people, peer support, community groups or other forms of emotional support. How Was Your Day is one peer-support option for people who want a private conversation with a real person.'],
  ['Is peer support an affordable alternative to therapy?', 'Peer support can cost less than many private therapy sessions, but it is not an equivalent service. It provides a different kind of support: human conversation and lived experience rather than clinical assessment or treatment.'],
