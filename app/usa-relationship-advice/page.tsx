        <h1>Your Relationship Was Fine in India.<br />America Changed Something.</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          Moving to the USA is supposed to be the beginning of something great. But for so many Indian couples,
          it is also when cracks quietly start to appear. Cultural drift, long-distance strain, arranged marriage
          adjustments, family pressure from 8,000 miles away — it is a lot to carry, often in silence.

          <ul className="checklist">
            <li>One of you adapts to American life faster — and the gap quietly widens.</li>
            <li>Your parents back home have opinions about every decision you make together.</li>
            <li>You are on H-1B and dependent on each other in ways that create new power dynamics.</li>
            <li>Arranged marriage adjustments are hard enough in India — in America, without family support, they are harder.</li>
            <li>You miss the weddings, the festivals, the moments that would have strengthened your bond back home.</li>
            <li>You are both working hard, both exhausted, and connection has become a low priority.</li>

          <h2>Arranged vs love marriage tensions in the USA</h2>

            — it wears you down in ways that are hard to explain to people who have not lived it.</p>
