          You&apos;re not alone — even if it feels that way right now. How Was Your Day connects you with real peer listeners in India who have been through what you&apos;re going through. No appointment needed.

          <h2>You deserve someone who truly understands</h2>
          <p>In India, it&apos;s often hard to find someone to talk to — really talk to. Family members may not understand or may judge you. Friends get tired of hearing about the same problems. Therapy feels too clinical or is simply too expensive. And at 2 AM when the feelings are worst, there&apos;s often no one available at all.</p>
          <p>How Was Your Day changes this. Our peer listeners go online at different hours — and they genuinely understand. Not because they have a degree, but because they have lived through something similar.</p>

          <h2>When do people reach out on How Was Your Day?</h2>
          <p>There is no wrong time or wrong reason to need someone to talk to. People connect with How Was Your Day listeners:</p>
          <div className="times">
            {['Late at night', 'After a fight', 'During exam season', 'After job loss', 'When grieving', 'Work burnout', 'Loneliness', 'Breakup', '2 AM anxiety', 'Career crisis', 'Moving to new city', 'Just to vent'].map(t => (

          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p><strong>1. Sign up in 30 seconds</strong> — just your phone number. No full name, no email.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Browse peer listeners</strong> — read their bios and find someone who gets your situation. Browse anonymously.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Start a 5-min chat</strong> — no wallet, no card, no commitment.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Talk</strong> — text or voice. Say what you need to say. Your listener is here for you.</p>

          <h2>What makes How Was Your Day different</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day listeners are not therapists — and that is often exactly why they are more helpful for day-to-day emotional struggles. They have lived through what you&apos;re going through. They are not constrained by clinical detachment. They are present, empathetic, and non-judgmental in a way that is hard to find elsewhere.</p>
          <p>The platform is designed for India: anonymous, text-first for privacy in joint homes, available in 12 Indian languages, and priced so that cost is never a barrier.</p>
