Research shows that feeling genuinely heard by another human is one of the most reliably useful interventions for emotional pain.

          <h1>Can&apos;t Afford Therapy? <em>Here Is What Actually Helps</em></h1>
          <p className="lead">Therapy in India costs ₹1,500–₹5,000 per session. For most people, that is genuinely unaffordable as a regular expense. This is not a judgment — it is just true. Here is an honest look at what actually exists at lower price points, including peer support from ₹160.</p>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>The Honest Price of Therapy in India Right Now</h2>
          <p>Let us put actual numbers on this. In major Indian cities, a 50-minute session with a licensed psychologist or therapist typically costs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>₹1,500–₹2,500 for a newer therapist or one working through a platform</li>
            <li>₹2,500–₹4,000 for a mid-career therapist with 5–10 years of experience</li>
            <li>₹4,000–₹6,000 or more for established practitioners in Mumbai and Delhi</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The professional consensus is that therapy needs to happen at least weekly to be effective — especially in the beginning. That is ₹6,000–₹24,000 a month. Per month. Every month, indefinitely, until you stop needing it.</p>
          <p>For context: the median monthly salary in urban India is roughly ₹25,000–₹35,000 for salaried workers. Regular therapy would consume 20–80% of a median income. This is not a small barrier. It is a wall for most people.</p>
          <p>Even at the lower end — ₹1,500 per session — two sessions a month adds ₹3,000 to a budget that likely already feels tight. Against rent, EMI payments, food, travel, and family obligations, mental health support is almost always the first thing to cut.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Why &quot;Just See a Therapist&quot; Is Harder Than It Sounds</h2>
          <p>The cost is the most visible barrier, but it is not the only one. Even people who can afford therapy often struggle to access it for reasons that are rarely discussed honestly.</p>

          <h3>Finding the Right Therapist Takes Time</h3>
          <p>Therapy is a relationship. The research on what makes therapy work consistently identifies the quality of the relationship between client and therapist as the most important factor — more than the specific method used. Finding a therapist who you actually feel comfortable with can take multiple attempts, each costing ₹1,500–₹4,000 per session. The &quot;shopping&quot; process itself is expensive.</p>

          <h3>Stigma Makes Starting Hard</h3>
          <p>In many Indian families and social contexts, seeing a therapist is still interpreted as a sign of serious mental illness rather than proactive self-care. The fear of being perceived as &quot;mad&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; keeps many people from taking the first step, even when they can afford it.</p>

          <h3>Availability Is a Real Problem</h3>
          <p>India has fewer than 0.3 psychiatrists and psychologists per 100,000 people. Good therapists in most Indian cities have waitlists. The experience of finally deciding to seek help and being told &quot;the earliest appointment is in six weeks&quot; is demoralising in a way that is hard to overstate.</p>

          <h3>Online Therapy Platforms Have Hidden Costs</h3>
          <p>Several online therapy platforms in India promise affordable rates, but the subscription model, session minimums, and add-on charges often bring the effective cost close to in-person rates. And you are still on the hook for the clinical context — diagnosis, treatment plans, weekly sessions — even if your needs are simpler.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Actually Fills the Gap</h2>
          <p>This is meant to be honest and practical, not a sales pitch. Here is a real accounting of what exists:</p>

          <h3>Friends and Family — Good but Limited</h3>
          <p>The people in your life are often the first place you turn, and for good reason. But they come with real limitations: they have their own emotional states and limits, they are involved in your situation in ways that complicate objectivity, and the social cost of repeatedly burdening them with your problems is real. Many people stop sharing with friends because they do not want to be seen as &quot;a lot.&quot;</p>

          <h3>Free Government Helplines — Crisis-Only</h3>
          <p>Samaritans (116 123) and Shout (text SHOUT to 85258) are run by the and are free, 24/7, and staffed by trained counsellors. They are genuinely useful in a crisis. But they are not designed for ongoing support or for the kind of regular processing that most people need — they are triaged for acute situations.</p>

          <h3>Journaling and Apps — Useful, But One-Sided</h3>
          <p>Writing, breathwork apps, and self-help tools can be genuinely useful as supplements. But they do not do the one thing that matters most: make you feel heard by another person. Research suggests that the felt experience of being understood by another human is qualitatively different from self-reflection, however rigorous.</p>

          <h3>Peer Support — The Real Middle Ground</h3>
          <p>Peer support sits between talking to friends (free, limited) and therapy (expensive, clinical). A screened peer listener is not a friend — they are an objective outside presence without a stake in your situation. And they are not a therapist — no diagnosis, no treatment framework, no clinical record. They are a person who has navigated hard things and been chosen for their ability to support others doing the same.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>What Peer Support Is and What It Costs</h2>
          <p>How Was Your Day connects you with peer listeners — real people with lived experience of emotional difficulty, screened for active listening and peer support frameworks. They are not therapists. They are also not just someone who is willing to talk to you. The training and vetting process matters.</p>

          <h3>What You Get in a Session</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A real person who is fully present and listening to you</li>
            <li>No agenda, no judgment, no advice unless you specifically ask</li>
            <li>Complete confidentiality — nothing leaves the conversation</li>
            <li>Flexibility to talk about whatever is actually on your mind</li>
            <li>No appointment; listeners are often online late at night</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What It Costs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Free 5-minute trial for new users</li>
            <li>₹160 for a 15-minute session</li>
            <li>₹249 for a 30-minute session</li>
            <li>₹329 for a 45-minute session</li>
          </ul>

          <p>There is no subscription, no minimum commitment, no recurring charge. You book when you need it and pay only for what you use. If one session a week costs ₹249, that is roughly ₹1,000 a month — a fraction of what therapy costs and more accessible than almost any other structured emotional support option available in India.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="section">
          <h2>Who Peer Support Is Right For</h2>
          <p>Peer support is not the right fit for everyone in every situation. Here is an honest guide to when it helps and when it does not.</p>

          <h3>Peer Support Works Well For</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Everyday emotional weight — stress, anxiety, loneliness, relationship difficulties</li>
            <li>Processing a difficult situation you have no one to talk to about</li>
            <li>Feeling stuck without knowing exactly why</li>
            <li>Needing regular emotional maintenance — a recurring check-in with someone objective</li>
            <li>Supplementing therapy between sessions</li>
            <li>People who are not yet sure if they need therapy</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When You Need Something More</h3>
          <p>If you are experiencing severe depression that prevents you from functioning, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts about harming yourself, trauma responses, or symptoms that have been present for months and are worsening — please seek a licensed mental health professional. Government psychiatric services at district and state hospitals provide free or low-cost care. How Was Your Day is not a substitute for clinical treatment in these cases.</p>

          <p>For most people, most of the time, the issue is not that severe — but it is real, and it deserves support. That is the gap peer support fills.</p>
