// Public pages deliberately kept OUT of search results (noindex, follow) and
// out of the sitemap. They stay live for anyone who has the link.
//
// Why (2026-09-24 SEO review): these queries bring the wrong audience —
// people looking for a paid "friend", stranger chat or chat jobs, or wanting
// something free — not seekers who pay for support. 2 of the first 5 paying
// users came for "friendship", and listener sign-ups far outnumber seekers.
// The ai-chatbot-alternative-<country> pages are ~90% identical to each other
// (doorway-page risk); /ai-chatbot-alternative stays indexed as the one version.
//
// To re-index a page: remove it here. Nothing else needs changing.
