//
// Billing rule: bill in whole minutes, rounding UP — a started minute counts
// (telecom convention), capped at the booked duration.
//
// WHY ceil, not floor: a session that runs its full course clocks in at
// e.g. 14m58s (accept/network latency eats a second or two). Math.floor
// turned that into 14/15 minutes, shaving the listener's earning and
// issuing a spurious refund to the seeker on every completed session.
// With ceil, 14m01s–15m00s all bill as the full 15 minutes; a genuinely
// early exit (say 7m10s) still pro-rates fairly (8/15).
//
// Sessions under 60 seconds are treated as accidental starts: full refund
// to the seeker (including the platform fee), nothing to the listener.
//
// LISTENER SERVICE FEE: How Was Your Day takes the rate in force when the session
// STARTED (serviceFeeRateAt, lib/constants.ts) out of the listener's share. This is
// entirely separate from PLATFORM_FEE (the seeker's flat ₹10) — the seeker's
// amountHeld and refundAmount math below are completely unaffected by this
// fee; the seeker never sees or pays it. The fee applies only to the
// listener's rawShare (full or pro-rated), so an early-exit session is
// charged the fee on the minutes actually earned, not the booked amount.
