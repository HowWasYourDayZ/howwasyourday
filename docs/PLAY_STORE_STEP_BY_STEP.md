# Launching the new LeanOn on Google Play — plain-English guide (v4, Oct 2026)

**Situation (confirmed 9 Oct 2026):**
- Developer account **LeanOn** (personal), created **Oct 2021** → **exempt from
  the 14-day / 12-tester rule**. A new app can go straight to production.
- The app already on Play (`app.leanon.therapy`, 2024) is a **legacy therapist
  app**, not today's LeanOn. We **retire it** and publish a **new app**,
  package **`app.leanon`**.

How the new app works: it's a thin Android "frame" (a **TWA — Trusted Web
Activity**) that opens www.leanon.app full-screen with no address bar. Website
changes reach the app instantly — no app update needed.

Whenever a step says "send to Claude", paste the value in chat. You never edit
files yourself. **Never send anyone the signing-key passwords — including Claude.**

## What you need
- A **laptop/desktop with Chrome** (most steps).
- An **Android phone** signed into a Gmail you control (testing).
- Your **Google Play Console** login.
- A **Google Drive** folder to keep the app's signing key safe.
- Time: **3–5 hours of clicking** in total. Google's review then takes
  **several days** (you just wait).

## PART 0 — Before you start (30 minutes)

### 0a. Unpublish the legacy app (do this first)
People searching "LeanOn" on Play today find the old therapist app (33 new
installs in the last 28 days). Two apps called LeanOn from one developer can
also be flagged as duplicates. Unpublishing is **reversible** and does not
delete anything; current installs keep working on those phones.
1. Play Console → **All apps** → open the old **LeanOn (`app.leanon.therapy`)**.
2. Left menu → **Test and release** → **Setup** → **Advanced settings**.
3. **App availability** tab → choose **Unpublished** → **Save** → confirm.
4. You can ignore that app's "Must fix" / data-safety warnings once it is
   unpublished — but **screenshot them and send to Claude** so we don't repeat
   the same mistakes in the new app's forms.

### 0b. Public developer profile (privacy)
The developer name and email are shown publicly on the Play Store.
1. ⚙ **Settings** → **Developer account** → **About you**.
2. Developer name is **`LeanOn`** ✅ (already correct).
3. Under **"Details shown as part of your Play developer profile"**, change the
   **Developer email** from `zubair@leanon.app` to a neutral address such as
   `support@leanon.app` (create it first if needed).
4. **Do not set up a merchant account** ("Monetize with Play"). LeanOn takes
   payments through Razorpay; a Play merchant account can make your **legal name
   and home address public** on the listing.
5. Open **Play developer profile** → preview it → confirm no full name or address
   appears.

---

## PART 1 — Things Claude does (before PART 7)
- **Reviewer login.** Google's reviewers can't receive your OTP SMS, so the
  "App access" form needs a demo login. Claude builds a locked-down one (switched
  on by a Vercel setting, one demo seeker account, no money, no listener access).
- **Website verification file** (`assetlinks.json`) once you send the
  fingerprints in PART 2 and PART 5.

---

## PART 2 — Build the Android app on PWABuilder (30 minutes)

1. On your laptop, open **https://www.pwabuilder.com** in Chrome.
2. In the box, type **`https://www.leanon.app`** → click **Start**.
3. Wait for the report card. Yellow/red warnings (e.g. "screenshots") are fine —
   ignore them.
4. Click **Package For Stores** (top right).
5. Under **Android**, click **Generate Package** (or **Options**).
6. Fill in the options **exactly** like this (leave anything not listed as is):

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Package ID | **`app.leanon`** |
   | App name | `LeanOn — Peer Support` |
   | Launcher name | `LeanOn` |
   | App version | `1.0.0` |
   | App version code | `1` |
   | Host | `www.leanon.app` |
   | Start URL | `/` |
   | Theme color | `#1A8FA0` |
   | Background color | `#0F4867` |
   | Nav color | `#0F4867` |
   | Display mode | **Standalone** |
   | Notification delegation | **ON** (listeners get request alerts) |
   | Location delegation | OFF |
   | Google Play billing | **OFF** |
   | Signing key | **Create new** |
   | Key full name | **`LeanOn`** (NOT your personal name) |
   | Key organization | `LeanOn` |
   | Key organizational unit | `App` |
   | Key country code | `IN` |
   | Key password / Store password | leave the generated ones |

7. Click **Download Package**. You get a **.zip** file.
8. **Right now, before anything else:** upload the whole .zip to a **private
   Google Drive folder** named `LeanOn Android signing — DO NOT DELETE`, and keep
   a second copy on a USB stick or another drive.
   - Inside are `signing.keystore` and `signing-key-info.txt` (passwords).
     You need them for every future app update.
   - **Never email them, never share them, never paste the passwords to anyone
     — including Claude.**
9. Unzip it on your computer. Find:
   - **`app-release-bundle.aab`** → this is what you upload to Google Play.
   - **`assetlinks.json`** → open it with Notepad. Copy the long code after
     `"sha256_cert_fingerprints"` (looks like `AB:12:CD:...`, 32 pairs).
     **Send that code to Claude** (it's public, safe to share).

---

## PART 3 — Create the app in Play Console (15 minutes)
1. **play.google.com/console** → **Create app** (top right).
2. Fill in:
   - App name: `LeanOn — Peer Support`
   - Default language: **English (India) – en-IN**
   - App or game: **App**
   - Free or paid: **Free**
3. Tick both declaration boxes → **Create app**.

---

## PART 4 — Upload to Internal testing (15 minutes)
Internal testing has **no Google review** — it's for you to try the app.

1. Left menu → **Test and release** → **Testing** → **Internal testing**.
2. Open the **Testers** tab → **Create email list** → name it `LeanOn team` →
   add **your Gmail** (the one on your Android phone) and 1–2 others → **Save**.
   Tick the list → **Save**.
3. Open the **Releases** tab → **Create new release**.
4. If asked about **Play App Signing**, choose the default
   (**"Use Google-generated key"**) → Continue.
5. Under **App bundles** → **Upload** → choose **`app-release-bundle.aab`**.
   Wait until it finishes processing.
   - If it shows an error about **target API level**, stop and tell Claude.
6. Release name: `1.0.0 (1)`. Release notes: `First internal test build.`
7. **Next** → **Save and publish** (or **Start rollout to Internal testing**) →
   confirm.
8. Back on the **Testers** tab, click **Copy link** under "How testers join".
   Send that link to your phone (WhatsApp it to yourself).

---

## PART 5 — Link the app to the website (5 minutes + Claude)
This removes the web address bar inside the app.

1. Left menu → **Test and release** → **App integrity** (or **Setup → App
   signing**).
2. Under **App signing key certificate**, copy the **SHA-256 certificate
   fingerprint**.
3. **Send it to Claude.** Claude puts both fingerprints (this one + the one from
   Part 2 step 9) into the website's `assetlinks.json` and deploys.
4. After Claude confirms, open
   **https://www.leanon.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json** in Chrome — you should
   see `app.leanon` and two long codes.

---

## PART 6 — Test on your Android phone (45 minutes — don't skip)
1. On the phone, open the tester link from Part 4 step 8 → **Accept invite** →
   **Download it on Google Play** → **Install**.
   (If Play says "not available", wait 30 minutes — new apps take time to appear.)
2. Open LeanOn and check each item:
   - [ ] **No address bar** at the top. (If you see one: wait 15 min, uninstall,
         reinstall. Still there → tell Claude.)
   - [ ] **Login** with your phone number + OTP works.
   - [ ] **Wallet recharge** with a small real payment → UPI app opens → after
         paying you come **back into LeanOn** and the balance updates.
   - [ ] **Voice session** with a second account (a friend as listener): the app
         asks for **microphone** permission, and both of you can hear each other.
   - [ ] **Notifications**: log in as a listener on the phone, allow
         notifications, go online, **close the app**, have someone request a
         session → the alert appears on the phone.
   - [ ] Tapping a **crisis number** opens the phone dialler.
   - [ ] The phone's **back button** behaves sensibly (doesn't trap you).
3. Anything wrong → tell Claude exactly what happened (a screenshot helps).
   Most fixes are website changes — no new upload needed.

---

## PART 7 — Store listing + App content (60–90 minutes)

### 7a. Main store listing
Left menu → **Grow users** → **Store presence** → **Main store listing**.
Copy text from **`docs/PLAY_STORE_LISTING.md`** in the repo.
- App name: `LeanOn — Peer Support`
- Short description (max 80 characters) and Full description: from that file.
- **App icon**: download **https://www.leanon.app/icon-512.png** (right-click →
  Save image as) and upload it.
- **Feature graphic** (1024 × 500): on **canva.com** search "Google Play feature
  graphic", put the LeanOn logo + "Someone to lean on, anytime." on a navy/teal
  background → Download PNG → upload.
- **Phone screenshots** (2–8): take them **inside the installed app** on your
  phone — home, browse listeners, a chat, wallet. **Hide or blur real users'
  names/photos** — use your own test accounts.
- App category: **Health & Fitness**. Contact email: your **support** address.
  Website: `https://www.leanon.app`.
- **Save**.

### 7b. App content (left menu → **Policy and programs** → **App content**)
Complete every item that shows "Start" / red:

| Item | What to choose |
|---|---|

| Content rating | Start questionnaire → category **All other app types** → answer honestly: users can **interact/communicate**: **Yes**; digital purchases: **Yes**; violence/sexual/drugs/gambling: **No**. Accept whatever rating comes out. |
| Target audience | **18 and over only**. "Appeals to children": **No** |

**Data safety answers** (if a question isn't covered here, screenshot it and send
to Claude):
- Collects data: **Yes**. Encrypted in transit: **Yes**. Users can request
  deletion: **Yes**.
- **Personal info → Phone number**: collected, required, purpose *Account
  management*. **Name** (display name): collected, purpose *App functionality*.
- **Personal info → Other** (listeners only: UPI/bank details for payouts):

  providers on LeanOn's behalf — that is not "sharing" under Google's definition).
- Data sold: **No**.

---

## PART 8 — Go live (10 minutes, then wait)
1. Left menu → **Test and release** → **Production** → **Countries/regions** →
   **Add countries** → India + USA, UK, Canada, Australia, UAE, Oman, Kuwait,
   Singapore, Malaysia (or all countries) → Save.
2. **Releases** → **Create new release** → **Add from library** → choose the
   `1.0.0 (1)` bundle you already uploaded → release notes:
   `LeanOn — talk to a real person, anytime.` → **Next** → **Save**.
3. Left menu → **Publishing overview** → **Send changes for review**.
4. Wait. A brand-new app usually takes **a few days, sometimes 1–2 weeks**
   (health apps get extra scrutiny). You get an email when it's live.
5. If Play Console says production access needs a closed test, **stop and tell
   Claude** — it shouldn't for an Oct 2021 account, but Google's screen decides.

---
## After launch
- Website changes appear in the app **immediately** — no app update.
- A **new app build** is only needed for Android-level changes (icon, name,
  notification settings, yearly Google target-API requirement every August).
  For that, rebuild on PWABuilder using **"Use existing key"** with the files
  from your Google Drive, and increase the **version code** (2, 3, …).

---

## Why not reuse the old app or the GitHub build
- The 2024 app is a different product (therapists), its package name says
  "therapy", and updating it needs its 2024 signing key.
- The GitHub "Build Android TWA" workflow and `android/` folder are deprecated:
  old Android target (API 34; Google now requires 36), a new signing key on
  every run, and the password printed in the build log.
