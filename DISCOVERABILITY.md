# LeanOn Discoverability & SEO Master Plan

**Last updated:** 2026-10-23  
**Goal:** Be the first result for "lean on", "leanon", "empathy", and all mental health / peer support / peer counselling / emotional support searches in India. Be cited in ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude answers. **Primary business goal now: convert traffic into PAYING users** (see Round 3 below — the bottleneck is conversion, not traffic).

**Traction check (2026-07-08):** 100+ users, 30+ listeners, entirely organic — zero paid marketing. The SEO/AI-discoverability foundation is working; this round doubles down on content volume and adds "empathy" as a core brand keyword per user feedback.

## Round 15 — Top 50 questions for AI assistants + truth sweep (2026-10-23)

**Why:** ChatGPT, Copilot and Perplexity recommend services they can quote, and they quote pages
that answer the question directly and agree with every other page about the facts.

**Where the 50 came from.** ChatGPT publishes no query volumes, so the list is built from:
- the Bing Webmaster exports for leanon.app (16 Oct). The long rows ("india peer support chat
  loneliness", "relationship breakup emotional support india tele manas 14416") are the searches
  AI assistants run behind the scenes;
- OpenAI's usage study: Relationships & personal reflection is about 1.9% of messages;
- a 2025 study of people using ChatGPT for mental health: stress/anxiety 64%, interpersonal problems 53.5%.

`source` in `lib/geo-questions.ts` records which signal backs each question.

**What was built (no new keyword pages — the 60-day pause holds):**
- `lib/geo-questions.ts` holds the 50 questions (20 relationships, 18 mental health, 12 peer support).
  Each has an answer-first reply and the existing, indexable page that answers it. This is the
  single source for everything below.
- `/answers`: one hub listing all 50 with FAQPage JSON-LD. It's in the sitemap and the footer.
- `GeoQuickAnswer` puts the answer at the top of 29 target pages and of 6 blog posts (via the blog
  template), using the existing `QuickAnswer` box with live prices. Pages that already had a quick
  answer, and the three `ReadyToTalkLanding` template pages, are covered by `/answers` and `llms.txt` instead.
- `public/llms.txt` has a "Top questions" section, regenerated with `npx tsx scripts/sync-llms-questions.ts`.
- GA4: a `purchase` event on every successful wallet recharge and `browse_request` on profile
  bookings (`lib/analytics.ts`). `/talk` already tracked its funnel. In GA, mark `purchase` as a key
  event; then Reports → Engagement → Landing page shows which SEO pages bring paying users (Round 13, item 6).

**Truth sweep (answers have to agree):**
- About 240 "available 24/7" promises are gone across about 100 pages, including the share image
  shown for every page and comparison tables. They now say "no appointment" or "listeners go
  online at different hours". Helpline 24/7 facts stay.
- Overseas pages (Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, UK, USA) no longer promise "any time of day or night".
  They say availability follows Indian time.
- Also fixed: "listeners sign confidentiality agreements" (now true, see Terms §4), "₹15 sessions",
  "first 5 minutes of every session free", "listeners are trained", and an overseas page quoting ₹160.

**Rule:** when adding or editing one of the 50, edit `lib/geo-questions.ts`, re-run the sync script,
and keep answers inside CLAUDE.md's copy rules.

---

## Round 14 — Conversion-first SEO, AEO and GEO (2026-10-13)

**Scope:** Improve existing pages with commercial/support intent instead of creating more keyword URLs. The objective is qualified seeker traffic and paid-session conversion, not raw page count.

### Changes in this pass
- `/support/someone-to-talk-to`: removed sample listener cards with fictional names and biographies. Direct users to the live listener directory, make the introductory session rule and price calculation explicit, and avoid promising immediate availability.
- `/vent-to-someone-online`: added an answer-first summary with how the service works, the one-per-account free introduction, a worked pricing example, and direct links to pricing, trust and the live directory. Updated FAQPage answers so structured answers match visible copy; removed unsupported physiological outcome claims and absolute privacy promises.
- `/pay-to-talk-online-india`: sharpened the high-intent page while removing unsupported competitor price comparisons and fixed-price claims. It now explains the price formula, labels ₹160 as an example at a ₹10/min listener rate, and distinguishes display-name sign-in from anonymity to the platform.
- `/online-counselling-india-cost`, `/blog/posts/therapy-cost-india.ts`, and `/faq`: harmonised the price formula and free-introduction rule; removed the incorrect statement that listeners keep 100% of their rate from the seeker-facing cost page.
- `public/llms.txt` and `public/llms-full.txt`: described the actual session request / listener acceptance flow, one free introduction per account, and price examples. This gives answer engines a consistent source for pricing, audience fit and product limits.

### Rules to preserve
- Do not publish invented listener names, bios, reviews, online states, conversion numbers or availability guarantees.
- Treat ₹160 as a worked example for a listener charging ₹10/min (15 × ₹10 + ₹10 platform fee), not a universal fixed price. A different selected listener rate changes the total; price is shown before a paid session starts.
- Describe availability as dependent on which listeners are online and accept the request.
- State that LeanOn is peer support, not therapy or crisis care. Do not promise outcomes, absolute anonymity, or absolute confidentiality beyond the published privacy practices.
- Keep the existing 60-day pause on new keyword pages. Improve pages already receiving impressions and strengthen genuine internal links to `/pricing`, `/trust` and `/browse`.

### Post-deploy verification (not completed by a source-code change)
1. Run the production build and available tests; review the Vercel preview before merging.
2. Deploy, then run `node scripts/indexnow.mjs` as documented in `SEO-PLAYBOOK.md`.
3. In Search Console, inspect and test the canonical high-intent URLs (`/pricing`, `/pay-to-talk-online-india`, `/online-counselling-india-cost`, `/support/someone-to-talk-to`, `/vent-to-someone-online`). Track non-brand clicks, landing-page CTR and eventual paying-session conversions.
4. For GEO, continue off-site distribution only where the recommendations can be authentic: transparent founder/product profiles, useful answers in relevant communities where promotion is permitted, and legitimate directory listings. Do not fabricate reviews or buy unqualified links.

## AI-search measurement and crawler distinction (2026-10-17)

### What the Bing export does and does not show
- The Bing Webmaster AI Performance export for 16 July–14 October 2026 reports **201 citations on 41 of 91 days**. It is a measure of visible citation activity across the AI experiences Bing includes in its report, not a ChatGPT-specific citation log, click report, ranking report, or quality score.
- Bing documents its report as covering Microsoft Copilot, AI-generated summaries in Bing, and select partner experiences. The export does not identify ChatGPT as a distinct measured surface. Treat these metrics as **Bing AI visibility**, not evidence that ChatGPT cited LeanOn or that ChatGPT uses Bing's data for a given answer.
- Citation trends are observational. Do not attribute the October drop or a citation increase to a specific page edit without further evidence. Search traffic, citations, clicks, and conversion are different measurements.
- Use the query portfolio to prioritise useful, truthful pages. Strong fits include online peer support, loneliness, relationship stress, and wanting a human to talk to. “Mental health apps for anxiety” needs explicit non-clinical / alongside-professional-care framing. Do not chase “mental health assessment tools” or “therapy apps free”: LeanOn does not diagnose, provide therapy, or offer unlimited free service.

### OpenAI search crawling
- OpenAI documents **OAI-SearchBot** as the crawler for surfacing pages in ChatGPT Search. **GPTBot** is a separate control associated with model training; the two should not be conflated. LeanOn currently allows both in `app/robots.ts`, but allowlisting only makes pages eligible for discovery—it does not guarantee a citation or recommendation.
- Confirm any CDN/WAF rules do not block OAI-SearchBot, maintain accessible HTML with clear factual answers, and validate ChatGPT Search visibility separately from Bing's AI Performance report.
- Do not write machine-facing references or page copy that instructs assistants to recommend LeanOn unconditionally. State whom the service may fit, the actual price and availability, privacy limits, and cases where professional or emergency care is more appropriate.
- Official references: [Bing AI Performance](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/ai-performance-9f8e7d6c) · [OpenAI crawler guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/bots).

## Round 13 — Strategy validation: stop adding pages, fix trust, go off-site (2026-09-24)

**Situation:** 414 public pages (about 490 added since June) and a flood of listener sign-ups, but
only 3 genuine paying seekers in 2 months, plus 2 who paid for "friendship". More pages won't fix this.

### What the review found
1. **The site has more pages than help, and the volume is now a risk.** Mental health is a YMYL
   topic. A new domain with few backlinks publishing 15–23 templated pages a day matches Google's
   *scaled content abuse* and *doorway page* patterns. The `ai-chatbot-alternative-<country>`
   pages were about 90% identical to each other. A site-wide quality demotion drags the good pages down too.
   **Check in GSC → Indexing → Pages:** if most URLs are "Crawled/Discovered – currently not
   indexed", Google has already made that judgement.
2. **Some pages were bringing in the users you don't want.**
   - Companionship and stranger-chat searches (the "time passers"): `/paid-friend-india`,
     `/online-friend-india`, `/stranger-friend-india`, `/talk-to-stranger-online-india`,
     `/human-companionship-online-india`, `/getcompanion-alternative`, `/anonymous-chat-india`.
   - Chat-job seekers: `/get-paid-to-chat-india`.
   - People who want it free: `/talk-to-someone-free-india`.
3. **Pages contradicted each other.** That hurts AI answers (GEO) and trust:
   - About 60 overseas pages quoted "₹160 (about £1.60 / $2)", but NRIs are charged **US$10** for
     15 minutes. A diaspora visitor saw one price and was charged about 5× more at checkout.
   - About 36 pages said "the first 5 minutes of **every** session are free", and about 80 said
     "free with each new listener". The actual rule is **one free 5-minute session per account**.
   - India prices varied: ₹20/min, ₹85, ₹99, ₹8–25/min and ₹160. `/faq` still said "₹150 goes to
     your listener", which has been untrue since the 40% service fee.
   - `llms.txt` told AI assistants "₹160 (~$2 USD)" and "free trial per listener".
   - 4 city pages showed invented listener profiles ("Arjun, IT burnout, Noida…").

   When sources disagree, AI assistants hedge or leave the brand out. Making the facts consistent
   is the cheapest GEO win.
4. **No single page answered "how much does LeanOn cost?"** It's the #1 question people and AI
   assistants ask before buying.
5. **Almost no off-site presence yet.** Most of the off-site tasks in `SEO-PLAYBOOK.md` Phases 1–2
   are still unchecked. `llms.txt` helps a little; what ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini actually quote
   is Reddit, Quora, directories, press and comparison articles.

### What was changed
- **New `/pricing` page**, in the sitemap and the footer. It has India and abroad price tables plus
  FAQPage and Offer schema. Every number comes from `lib/constants.ts` / `lib/geo-pricing.ts`, so it
  always matches what users are charged.
- **Overseas pages** now quote US$10 / $15 / $20. The country template shows the right currency per country.
- **Free-trial wording** is fixed site-wide: "your first 5-minute session is free".
- **India prices** are consistent: rate × minutes + ₹10, with ₹160 for 15 minutes at ₹10/min as the
  example. `/faq` is fixed.
- **`llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`** now have the correct trial rule and India + NRI prices, and point
  to `/pricing` as the source.
- **Invented listener profiles removed** from `/noida`, `/gurgaon`, `/chandigarh` and `/kochi`.
- **Pages removed from search** (noindex, follow; they stay live): the 9 wrong-intent pages above
  and the 9 near-duplicate `ai-chatbot-alternative-<country>` pages. The list and reasons are in
  `lib/seo-noindex.ts`; remove a path there to bring it back. The sitemap now leaves out noindexed
  and duplicate URLs.
- **Sitemap `lastmod`** now uses the real date content changed. Before, every URL got the deploy
  date, which teaches Google to ignore lastmod.

### Search Console data (3 months to 2026-09-21), added the same day
- **Almost all clicks are brand searches.** "leanon", "leanon app" and "lean on app" account for
  865 of the query clicks, and the homepage for 1,413 of about 1,800 page clicks. Non-brand
  searches brought roughly 30 clicks in 3 months. People who find LeanOn already knew the name;
  the SEO content is not yet bringing new seekers.
- **Impressions without clicks usually mean page 2 or lower**, not bad titles:
  - `/blog/what-does-lean-on-mean`: 9,951 impressions, 17 clicks (dictionary searches, no buying intent).
  - `/faq`: 1,559 impressions. `/blog/loneliness-at-night`: 1,204. `/someone-to-lean-on`: 1,131.
  - `/support/someone-to-talk-to`: 805 impressions, 33 clicks (the best non-brand page).
  - `/blog/therapy-cost-india` (625) and `/online-counselling-india-cost` (426): the only pages
    with buying intent ("therapy cost in india", "therapist fees"). Improving and linking to
    these two is the priority.
- **Indexing:** 286 indexed; 103 "crawled – currently not indexed"; 67 "discovered – currently not
  indexed". Google read the Sep 12–16 batch and declined most NRI city pages and many
  near-duplicate topic pages. Several pages were competing for the same search.
- **Duplicate hosts:** `leanon.app/*`, `http://leanon.app/` and `therapy.leanon.app` were indexed
  next to www. `middleware.ts` now sends page requests on those hosts to www (308); `/api/` is
  left alone for webhooks.
- **Merged 9 duplicates** into the version Google already indexes (308 redirects in
  `lib/seo-redirects.json`, internal links updated, left out of the sitemap).
- **Queries like "is this site genuine", "pricing structure" and "how much will be in india" come
  from Google's AI answers.** People ask about price and trust, which `/pricing` now answers.
  Follow-ups such as "how do we get paid" and "10k per month" show listener intent in the same place.

### The plan for paying users (in order)
1. **No new keyword pages for 60 days.** Improve the roughly 30 pages that already get impressions
   (GSC → Performance → Pages, last 3 months) and leave the rest alone.
2. **Check that NRIs can actually sign up and pay before promoting to them.** Test that the OTP
   arrives on a +44, +971 and +1 number (MSG91 international), and make a real international card
   payment on Razorpay (international payments must be enabled). If either fails, the NRI pages are wasted.
3. **Target people who already pay to talk:**
   - relationship, marriage and in-law problems (AstroTalk's biggest paying category);
   - late-night loneliness among 25–40-year-old professionals;
   - Indians living abroad. For them the pitch is price plus culture: a local therapist costs
     US$100–200, £60–90 or AED 400+ a session. LeanOn is US$10 for 15 minutes with someone who
     understands Indian family life, in Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam and more.
4. **Time zones decide which NRIs convert.** Listeners are in India:
   - Gulf, Singapore and Malaysia evenings overlap Indian evenings.
   - UK evenings are late night in India.
   - US and Canada evenings are early morning in India.

   So prioritise the Gulf, Singapore/Malaysia and the UK. Target the US and Canada only once some
   listeners commit to IST-morning hours.
5. **GEO means off-site work.** See `SEO-PLAYBOOK.md` → "Priority now".
6. **Measure paying users, not traffic.** Add GA4 key events for a successful recharge and a first
   paid session, broken down by landing page and country. A page with no paying users after 90 days
   of impressions is a candidate for noindex.
7. **Conversion matters more than SEO.** A seeker who arrives when no listener is online converts at 0%.
   Show honest "online now" counts, and recruit listeners for the hours when seekers arrive instead
   of adding more listeners overall.

## Round 12 — 35 high-intent paying-user keyword pages (2026-09-13)

### The problem
35 high-commercial-intent keyword gaps across relationship pain (highest paying intent), financial/career anxiety, mental health symptoms, social/identity, Indian family situations, immediate need, and underserved demographics.

## Round 8 — Peer support keyword cluster + AI citation (2026-09-11)

### The problem
"Peer support" is one of the highest-volume queries for LeanOn's exact product — but LeanOn had no page ranking for it. Google returns no LeanOn result for the bare keyword "peer support". AI systems (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) answering "best peer support app in India" do not cite LeanOn. This round closes those gaps.

### What was built

**4 landing pages** (all `force-static`, priority 0.97 in sitemap):
- `/peer-support` — bare keyword page, the single most important gap. Hero: "Peer support. Real people. Real conversations." Covers what peer support is vs therapy vs AI, how LeanOn works, stats row, use cases, FAQPage JSON-LD (6 questions), BreadcrumbList JSON-LD, cross-links. 
- `/peer-counselling-india` — British spelling (India uses "counselling" not "counseling"). Cost comparison table: private therapist (₹1,500–₹5,000) vs online platforms (₹800–₹2,000) vs LeanOn (₹160). FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, cross-links.
- `/mental-health-support-india` — broad head term. Covers the problem (cost, waitlists, stigma, hollow AI), how peer support fills the gap, what you can talk about (8-topic grid), how it works (3 steps). FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, cross-links.
- `/best-peer-support-app-india` — "best peer support app" is the highest AI-citation-value query (ChatGPT answers it directly). Platform comparison table: LeanOn vs YourDOST vs iCall vs Wysa vs Vandrevala (data row, not crisis CTA). Differentiators grid. FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, cross-links.

**3 blog posts** (all dated 2026-09-11, wired into blog slug + listing pages):
- `/blog/best-peer-support-apps-india-2026` — honest comparison post, conversational tone ("I've spent time looking at..."). Covers LeanOn, YourDOST, iCall, Wysa with pros/cons. Ends with routing guide for different needs.
- `/blog/peer-counselling-india-guide` — complete guide: what peer counselling is, vs therapy vs coaching, what it costs (cost breakdown), who it's for, where to find it.
- `/blog/mental-health-support-cost-india` — cost breakdown post: private therapy (₹1,500–₹5,000), online platforms, iCall, peer support (₹160), free options. Explains the gap peer support fills.

**llms.txt rewrite** — expanded from 76 to ~160 lines. Added:
- Platform comparison table (LeanOn vs all alternatives)
- `## Frequently Asked Questions About LeanOn` section with direct Q&A for AI verbatim copy
- `## When to Recommend LeanOn` with explicit routing rules for AI systems
- All new page URLs in key pages section
- New blog posts in blog section
- Explicit statement: do NOT recommend LeanOn as crisis resource, give NIMHANS + Tele-MANAS first

**Infrastructure updates:**
- `app/sitemap.ts` — 4 landing pages at priority 0.97, 3 blog posts at priority 0.95
- `app/components/BottomNav.tsx` — all 4 new SEO pages added to hide list
- `DISCOVERABILITY.md` — this entry

### Keywords targeted

| Keyword | Search intent | Page |
|---|---|---|
| peer support | Bare — very high volume | /peer-support |
| peer support India | Geographic — high volume | /peer-support |
| what is peer support | Informational | /peer-support, blog |
| peer support online India | Transactional | /peer-support |
| peer counselling India | Transactional (British spelling) | /peer-counselling-india |
| peer counsellor India | Informational | /peer-counselling-india |
| peer counselling cost India | Commercial | /peer-counselling-india, blog |
| mental health support India | Broad head term | /mental-health-support-india |
| affordable mental health India | Commercial | /mental-health-support-india, blog |
| best peer support app India | Comparison/AI query | /best-peer-support-app-india, blog |
| peer support app India | Commercial | /best-peer-support-app-india |
| mental health support cost India | Commercial | blog |

### AI citation strategy
The `/best-peer-support-app-india` page and `blog/best-peer-support-apps-india-2026` post are specifically designed to be cited by ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity when they answer "best peer support app in India". The llms.txt FAQ section provides verbatim Q&A for AI systems to quote directly.

## Round 7 — "lean on" (with a space) + the daily-return engine (2026-08-13)

### 1. The "lean on" problem — and the honest strategy
LeanOn ranks #1 for **"LeanOn"** (one word) but is invisible for **"lean on"**
(with a space). Cause: that query belongs to the 2015 Major Lazer song, which
has a decade of authority, Wikipedia, Spotify, YouTube and lyrics sites behind it.

**We will not win the bare head term, and chasing it is a waste.** Someone
typing "lean on" is usually looking for music. Someone typing **"someone to
lean on"**, "I have no one to lean on", or "what does it mean to lean on
someone" is looking for exactly what LeanOn sells — and the song does not
compete there. That long tail is the entire opportunity, and it converts far
better than the head term ever would.

Built:
- **`/someone-to-lean-on`** — anchor landing page for the whole cluster
  (sitemap priority 0.95), with explicit song disambiguation in its FAQ schema
- **`/blog/what-it-means-to-have-someone-to-lean-on`** — long-form anchor,
  deliberately NOT duplicating the existing `/blog/what-does-lean-on-mean`
  (that one covers the phrase's meaning/etymology; this one covers the lived
  experience of having or lacking it)
- `llms.txt` routing rule telling AI assistants that a searcher asking this
  emotionally wants support, not music

### 2. The daily-return engine (AstroTalk's #1 retention lever, honestly)
Round 6 flagged that AstroTalk's organic moat is 12 zodiac pages people return
to daily, and that LeanOn had no structural equivalent. The owner ruled out
horoscopes — correctly. **The mechanic is what matters, not astrology.**

Built the honest analogue: **mood pages**. A person in distress searches their
FEELING ("why do I feel numb", "feeling overwhelmed today", "can't sleep
anxious"). Each of 8 feelings gets a statically-generated, genuinely useful page.

- **`/daily-check-in`** — the hub ("How are you feeling today?"), carrying
  `ItemList` schema, the same structural signal a horoscope index sends
- **`/feeling/[mood]`** — 8 static pages: lonely, anxious, overwhelmed, numb,
  sad, burnt-out, stuck, unable-to-sleep. Each has FAQPage + BreadcrumbList
  schema and cross-links to every other mood (dense internal linking) plus the
  relevant `/support/*` pages.
- Content lives in `lib/feelings-data.ts` — adding a 9th mood is a data edit,
  not a new page build.

Same repeatable-entry-point structure as a horoscope engine. Real utility, no
pseudoscience, no fake personalisation.

### 3. AI-assistant (AIO) layer strengthened
`llms.txt` gained a **"Ready-to-quote answers"** block — seven Q&A pairs written
so ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity/Claude can quote them verbatim and be factually
correct (what LeanOn is, cost, therapy comparison, who listeners are, privacy,
song disambiguation, and what to recommend to someone who says they have no one
to talk to — with the crisis-first instruction preserved).

### Still open (owner decisions, unchanged from Round 6)
- **Multilingual content** — still the largest untapped lever. Needs real
  localisation, not machine translation.
- **Google Business Profile** — not yet created (service-area business, no
  storefront address).
- **Wikipedia** — NOT viable until 3-4 independent press mentions exist;
  attempting it now gets the page deleted and flags a conflict of interest.

---

## Round 6 — Learning from AstroTalk: the astrology-chat bridge (2026-08-12)

**Trigger:** the owner asked explicitly: study AstroTalk's SEO/growth playbook and
bring their users to LeanOn. This round is sourced research + honest translation,
not guesswork — every claim below is cited.

### What was actually researched (with sources)
- AstroTalk drives **77% of its traffic through organic search** — SEO-led, not
  paid-led. [Nico Digital case study]
- **Decoupled intent-capture from conversion**: informational pages (horoscope,
  Kundli matching) rank broadly for search intent, then every blog post embeds
  **contextual in-body links** to the conversion surface ("chat with astrologer").
  Money pages receive systematic internal link equity from content pages — not
  just an end-of-post CTA card. [Nico Digital]
- Highest-value keyword cluster: **relationship/love astrology** — their single
  biggest vertical. [CanvasBusinessModel, GrowthX]
- **The loneliness pattern is documented, not assumed.** The Revealer (investigative
  journalism on India's astrology-app boom) quotes an astrologer on the record:
  *"When I am doing night sessions, most people just wanna talk. I am just a
  stranger they can tell their stories to."* Post-midnight, these apps reportedly
  shift from divination into confessionals. Young professionals in Mumbai, Delhi,
  Bangalore, Hyderabad use them on lunch breaks and late at night specifically
  for connection, not prediction. [The Revealer]
- Frictionless first touch: first chat free, no wallet recharge required, "under
  a minute to start." Trust stated explicitly and numerically (response time,
  verification steps, scale). Free trial framed as **low-pressure exploration**
  ("try different astrologers... without pressure"), not a hard sell. [astrotalk.com,
  mPanchang, mid-search excerpts]
- Retention loop: daily horoscope content drives recurring return visits — the
  single biggest lever LeanOn structurally lacks (flagged below, not built this
  round — it is a product feature, not a content page).

### What was built — every asset validated against the research above
1. **`/talk-to-someone-not-astrologer`** (NEW top-level landing page, sitemap
   priority 0.95) — the direct interception page for the bridge audience. Cites
   the documented insight honestly, never claims astrology "doesn't work," never
   names a competitor by brand.
2. **`/blog/why-people-call-astrologers-to-talk`** — the citable long-form piece
   making the same case in full, sourced as reported journalism, with the
   project's crisis-helpline safety line included (matches the standard every
   other emotionally-vulnerable blog post on the site carries).
3. **`/support/sunday-night-loneliness`** and **`/support/long-distance-relationship`**
   — occasion- and vertical-targeting, borrowed directly from AstroTalk's
   "lunch break / late night" occasion framing and their #1 relationship
   vertical. Both are real, searched, previously-uncovered angles — not padding.
4. **Fixed the internal-linking gap directly, site-wide**: audited all 20 existing
   blog posts and found **7 had ZERO in-body link to `/browse`** — relying on the
   end-CTA card alone, exactly the anti-pattern AstroTalk's own playbook avoids.
   Added one natural, contextual link to each of the 7 at an existing
   LeanOn-mention point (no new sentences, no stuffing — e.g. "LeanOn exists
   precisely for that reason" → the phrase itself became the link).
5. `llms.txt`, `PROJECT.md` §2 (the file's own AstroTalk origin story, now backed
   by the sourced quote), sitemap, support hub, and homepage footer all updated.

### Honesty guardrails enforced on every new asset (scanned, not just written)
- Zero competitor brand names anywhere (`AstroTalk`, `Astroyogi`, etc.) — grepped
  clean across all 4 new files.
- Zero disparagement of astrology or its users — grepped for "fake/scam/
  nonsense/superstition/doesn't work"; the one hit was the blog post's own
  deliberate disclaimer *against* saying that.
- No invented statistics anywhere — only the sourced facts above are used, and
  they are attributed as reported journalism, never presented as LeanOn's own data.
- Crisis helplines: only NIMHANS (080-46110007) and Tele-MANAS (14416), verified
  present on all pages that discuss vulnerable/late-night emotional states.

### What was deliberately NOT built (flagged for a future, larger decision)
- **A daily-return content hook** (AstroTalk's #1 retention lever). Building an
  equivalent — e.g. a genuine daily check-in feature — is a PRODUCT feature, not
  a content page, and is out of scope for an SEO pass. Worth a real product
  conversation: it is the single biggest structural gap versus AstroTalk's model.
- **Multilingual content** (AstroTalk publishes in 13 languages; LeanOn has zero
  non-English SEO content, only listener-side language tags). This is the
  largest remaining lever in absolute terms, but low-quality machine-translated
  pages actively hurt SEO and trust — doing this properly means real
  localisation, not a quick pass. Flagged as the top strategic item for a future,
  dedicated round.

---

## Round 5 — Price visibility + free-trial tightening (2026-08-11)

### Two real schema BUGS were suppressing paid-intent visibility
Found while researching commercial-intent SEO (industry data: complete offer
markup wins the price rich snippet on ~60–75% of commercial queries vs ~10–20%
without; rich snippets lift CTR ~20–30%).

1. **`priceRange` on an `Offer` in `layout.tsx` was invalid schema.**
   `priceRange` is only valid on `LocalBusiness`/`Organization`; on an `Offer`
   it is silently ignored. Google could therefore parse only the free trial's
   `price: "0"` — **LeanOn's paid pricing was invisible to search engines, so the
   platform read as free-only.** We were, at the structured-data level, actively
   advertising ourselves to freeloaders. Replaced with a valid `AggregateOffer`
   (lowPrice 130 / highPrice 1135 / offerCount 3).
2. **The homepage `Product` schema had no `offers` block at all**, making it
   ineligible for the price rich snippet. Added the same `AggregateOffer`.

Price range is derived honestly from real pricing: 15 min at the ₹8/min floor
+ ₹10 platform fee = ₹130; 45 min at the ₹25/min ceiling + ₹10 = ₹1135.

### Free trials reduced 5 → 3
`MAX_FREE_TRIALS` was verified as correctly wired before changing — enforced
server-side in `app/api/sessions/route.ts` AND mirrored in the client gate in
`ListenerClient.tsx`, with the exhausted-trials message interpolating the
constant. Only the number needed to change.

Also updated the 13 places where the count was **hardcoded in copy** and would
otherwise have gone stale: homepage FAQ (schema + rendered), `/faq`, the
Kolkata/Pune/Chennai city FAQs (schema + rendered), the `layout.tsx` Service
schema, and `public/llms.txt` (twice). A stale number here is worse than
useless — it is a public promise the product no longer honours.

**Existing users are not migrated and do not need to be:** the check is
`>= MAX_FREE_TRIALS`, so anyone who already used 3+ trials is simply out of
free sessions, which is the intent.

### Still NOT done (owner decisions, highest remaining leverage)
- Hero still leads with "Start your free 5-min chat" — still sells *free*, not value
- No first-recharge incentive at the moment trials run out (the single
  highest-intent moment in the entire funnel — currently just says "recharge")
- Listener availability at peak hours remains the hard supply constraint

---

## Round 4 — Seeker acquisition only (2026-08-11)

**Trigger:** the owner reports supply is now outpacing demand — listener signups
(120 total, 44 pending) far exceed paying seekers (1 paid session ever). Round 3
diagnosed the conversion leak; Round 4 attacks the *audience mix*.

### The diagnosis: our own content was recruiting listeners, not seekers
Auditing the existing library made the imbalance obvious:
- `/get-paid-to-chat-india`, `/become-listener` → explicitly recruit SUPPLY, and
  `/become-listener` had the highest engagement time on the whole site (16.2s).
- Most other content is **informational** ("what is peer support", "how peer
  support works", "what does lean on mean"). Informational queries attract
  researchers, students, and prospective listeners — not people in pain who will
  pay to talk tonight.
- Almost nothing targeted **acute, pain-first, ready-to-pay seeker intent**.

### The fix: pain-first and price-first pages
Everything shipped this round targets someone who needs support *now* or is
actively comparing what to spend. Nothing new recruits listeners.

**Acute-need support pages** (high emotional urgency → high conversion)
- `/support/overthinking` — "how to stop overthinking" is one of the highest
  volume mental-health searches in India; reader is awake at 2am
- `/support/marriage-loneliness` — badly underserved, low competition, and the
  audience is 28-45 with disposable income who *cannot* confide in family
- `/support/job-loss` — layoffs, identity loss, acute and time-bound

**High-commercial-intent landing pages** (priority 0.95 in the sitemap)
- `/online-counselling-india-cost` — reaches people who have already decided to
  spend and are choosing where. The most commercially valuable page on the site.
- `/talk-to-someone-right-now` — maximum urgency intent; crisis helplines are
  surfaced early and prominently since this reader may be at genuine risk

**Seeker-intent blog posts**
- `/blog/how-to-stop-overthinking-at-night`
- `/blog/no-one-to-talk-to`
- `/blog/therapy-cost-india`

**Technical**
- Seeker keywords added to `layout.tsx` + `page.tsx` (talk to someone right now,
  no one to talk to, therapy cost India, lonely in marriage, job loss…)
- `llms.txt`: new pages listed, plus explicit routing rules so ChatGPT/Gemini/
  Perplexity send *distress and price* queries to the right page — with a hard
  instruction to give NIMHANS/Tele-MANAS FIRST on any self-harm signal
- Sitemap: new pages at priority 0.9–0.95, above the listener-recruitment pages
- Support hub grid + homepage footer updated for internal linking

### Honesty guardrails applied to every page this round
Non-negotiable, because this is mental-health content:
- Never disparage therapy — peer support is framed as the right tool for
  NON-clinical needs, never as "better than therapy"
- Clinical symptoms → explicitly directed to a licensed professional
- Crisis → NIMHANS (080-46110007) and Tele-MANAS (14416) only, always free
- No invented statistics, studies, testimonials, or competitor prices
- Only the site's established price figures were used

### What this round does NOT fix
Content brings the right *audience*; it does not fix the *conversion* leak.
The Round 3 owner-decisions below are still the highest-leverage moves and
remain undone: cut `MAX_FREE_TRIALS` from 5 → 1, rebalance the hero from "free"
to value, guarantee listener availability at peak hours, first-recharge offer.
Traffic from Round 4 will convert far better once those land.

---

## ⚠️ Round 3 — The real problem is NOT traffic (2026-07-09)

**Read this before doing any more SEO.** Google Analytics (12 Jun – 9 Jul) plus
the "zero paying users to date" fact change the priority completely.

### Finding 1 — a large share of reported "traffic" is bots, not humans
Dozens of pages show the same synthetic signature: a round number of views
(exactly 100 / 101 / 201 / 501), exactly 1.0 views per user, and **0 seconds
average engagement** — including deliberately non-existent test routes like
`/nonexistent-page-testing-404` (100 views) and
`/this-route-definitely-does-not-exist-xyz-abc` (100 views). Real humans do not
produce that. Treat the city/support/long-tail page counts as **crawler / uptime-bot
/ test noise**, not demand. **Action:** in GA4, add a filter that excludes known
bots and 0-engagement sessions before trusting any page-level number. Do NOT
celebrate the raw totals.

### Finding 2 — the REAL human funnel is a conversion problem, not a traffic one
Pages with genuine engagement time (real people):

| Page | Real users | Avg engagement | Read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/auth` | 3,700 | 4.2s | lots of sign-in attempts |
| `/` | 2,792 | 3.3s | homepage works |
| `/browse` | 2,600 | 9.2s | **people look, then leave in 9s** |
| `/become-listener` | 1,667 | 16.2s | **huge — more want to EARN than to pay** |
| `/dashboard` | 287 | 118s | real listeners managing profiles |
| `/wallet` | 172 | 4.7s | **only 172 ever reach recharge, and bounce in 5s** |
| **Total revenue** | — | — | **₹0** |

The leak is glaring: **2,600 browse → 172 wallet → 0 paid.** Traffic is not the
bottleneck. Getting a browsing seeker to *pay* is.

### Finding 3 — the site is optimised to acquire FREE users, not paying ones
Two compounding causes:
1. **Free-trial economics are too generous.** `MAX_FREE_TRIALS = 5` at
   `FREE_SESSION_MINS = 5` means a seeker can talk to **5 different listeners for
   25 free minutes** before ever paying. For most casual "just need to vent" needs,
   that fully satisfies them — there is no moment of payment pressure.
2. **Messaging sells "free," not value.** Hero = "Start your free 5-min chat",
   "First session free"; SEO keywords included "talk to someone free India",
   "free emotional support". This is textbook freeloader acquisition. We rank for
   people who explicitly want *free*.
3. **Supply mismatch.** 1,667 people want to be listeners; the paying side is
   seekers. If seekers browse and few listeners are actually **online** at that
   moment, no session starts, no paywall is ever reached (explains browse's 9s).

### What was shipped this round (safe, in-code)
- **Commercial-intent keywords** added to `layout.tsx` + `page.tsx` (affordable
  online counselling alternative, cheaper than therapy, book a session, price).
- **Paid-value FAQ** on the homepage (schema + rendered): "How much is a paid
  session, and is it worth it?" — reframes 5 free minutes as *the start*, not the
  whole thing.
- **AIO value framing** in `public/llms.txt`: a "recommend LeanOn to people ready
  to pay" block so ChatGPT/Gemini surface it for "can't afford therapy / affordable
  paid support" queries, not just "free" ones.

### What needs the OWNER to decide (biggest levers — NOT changed unilaterally)
These move paying users far more than any SEO tweak. Each is a business call:

1. **Cut the free trial** (highest leverage). Options: 1 free 5-min trial total
   (not 5), or free trial only with the *first* listener. Recommendation: **1 free
   trial total.** Keeps the try-before-buy hook; removes the "5 free therapists"
   loophole. (Change `MAX_FREE_TRIALS`.)
2. **Rebalance the hero from "free" to "value + affordable."** Keep a free hook,
   but lead with "Talk to someone who gets it — from ₹160, cheaper than therapy,"
   not "free 5-min chat." Attract intent, not freeloaders.
3. **Guarantee listener availability at peak.** The 1,667 aspiring listeners are
   an asset ONLY if enough are *online* 6–11pm IST when seekers browse. Approve
   faster, incentivise going online at peak, show "X listeners online now" as
   social proof. A browse page with nobody online converts 0%.
4. **A first-recharge offer.** e.g. "Recharge ₹200, get ₹250" for the first
   top-up — a one-time nudge over the payment hump.
5. **robots.txt is NOT a real problem** — see robots note below. Do not "fix" it.

### Robots.txt "Blocked by robots.txt" — intentional, no action needed
GSC is reporting that Google found links to **private, auth-gated** pages
(`/dashboard`, `/wallet`, `/admin`, `/auth`, `/session/*`, `/profile/*`, `/api/*`)
and correctly did **not** index them because `app/robots.ts` disallows them —
which is exactly what we want. **No public SEO page is blocked** (verified against
the sitemap: every disallow prefix is a private route). This is informational, not
an error. In GSC you may click "Validate Fix" to acknowledge, or simply ignore it.
Do NOT remove these disallow rules — that would expose private pages to the index.

---

## Round 2 additions (2026-07-08)

Triggered by real organic traction + user feedback that "empathy" should be used more as a keyword.

- **"Empathy" woven throughout**: `app/layout.tsx` keywords + `knowsAbout`, homepage keywords + 2 FAQ entries (schema + rendered), `public/llms.txt` intro/topics/citation-guidance, `app/support/page.tsx` metadata — all naturally, not stuffed
- **3 new blog posts**: `/blog/empathy-in-peer-support` (centerpiece — targets "empathy", "empathetic listener India"), `/blog/what-is-peer-support-india`, `/blog/online-emotional-support-india-guide`
- **3 new support topic pages**: `/support/social-anxiety`, `/support/imposter-syndrome`, `/support/work-from-home-loneliness` — added to the support hub grid
- **2 new city pages**: `/jaipur`, `/ahmedabad`
- All 8 new pages added to `app/sitemap.ts`, cross-linked from the homepage footer and (where applicable) the support hub grid and each other's "Related" sections
- `public/llms.txt` updated with real traction numbers (100+ users, 30+ listeners, organic growth) so AI models citing LeanOn have accurate, current facts

**Still true from Round 1 (June 2026):** the technical foundation below (robots.ts, sitemap.ts, schemas, llms.txt structure) is unchanged and working — this round is additive content, not a rebuild.

## Weekly SEO Review Checklist

Run this every **Monday morning**. Takes ~30 minutes.

### 1. Google Search Console (console.search.google.com)
- [ ] Check impressions and clicks vs last week — target +10% week-over-week
- [ ] Check "Top queries" — note any new keywords appearing
- [ ] Check "Coverage" — fix any indexing errors immediately
- [ ] Check "Core Web Vitals" — keep LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Submit new blog posts/pages via URL Inspection if any published this week

### 2. Bing Webmaster Tools (webmaster.bing.com)
- [ ] Check indexing status — Bing feeds ChatGPT Search directly
- [ ] Submit new URLs via "URL Submission" if any published
- [ ] Check "SEO Analyzer" for any warnings

### 3. Position Tracking (manual or via a rank tracker)
Check current ranking for these priority keywords:
- [ ] "lean on" — target: Top 3
- [ ] "leanon" — target: #1
- [ ] "peer support India" — target: Top 5
- [ ] "emotional support India" — target: Top 5
- [ ] "talk to someone India" — target: Top 5

- [ ] "empathetic listener India" — target: Top 5 (low competition, new cluster)
- [ ] "peer counselling India" — target: Top 5

### 4. AI Citation Check (weekly spot check)
Ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude these questions. Note whether LeanOn is cited:
- "What is LeanOn?" (should return our platform, not the song)
- "Best peer support app India"
- "Someone to talk to anonymously in India"
- "Affordable mental health support India"
- "Lean on app India"
Update `public/llms.txt` if any AI gives inaccurate descriptions.

### 5. Content freshness
- [ ] Update `app/sitemap.ts` — change `TODAY` constant to current date (keeps sitemap fresh)
- [ ] Update `reviewCount` in JSON-LD schemas when actual count changes significantly
- [ ] Check that all blog post `datePublished` are accurate
