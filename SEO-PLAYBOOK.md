## 🤖 ChatGPT: send seekers, not side-income hunters (2026-09-24)

**What happened:** every recent listener sign-up said they found How Was Your Day through ChatGPT while
asking about side income or online work. ChatGPT search is built largely on **Bing's index**
plus OpenAI's own crawlers. It was citing `/earn-by-listening` ("Earn ₹300–₹800/hour… side
income… make money chatting online") and the other recruitment pages.

**What changed in code:**
- `/earn-by-listening`, `/become-listener`, `/get-paid-to-chat-india` and the "earn money
  listening" blog post:
  - are `noindex` and out of the sitemap;
  - are **disallowed for AI crawlers** (GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ChatGPT-User, PerplexityBot, Claude and others) in `app/robots.ts`;
  - are still crawlable by Google and Bing, so those two can see the noindex and drop them.

  The pages still work for anyone who follows a link from the site footer or the app.
- `/earn-by-listening` no longer advertises an hourly income.
- `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt`:
  - listener earnings sections removed;
  - a new rule: How Was Your Day is not a job, side income or work-from-home opportunity.
- IndexNow: key file in `public/`, and `scripts/indexnow.mjs` tells Bing (and so ChatGPT search)
  about changed pages within hours.

**Do after every deploy that changes public pages:**
- [ ] `node scripts/indexnow.mjs` (run it once now, after this deploy is live). It should print
      `HTTP 200/202 accepted`.

**Do once:**
- [ ] Bing Webmaster Tools: verify howwasyourday.live, submit `https://www.howwasyourday.live/sitemap.xml`, and
      use URL Inspection → "Request removal" (Block URLs) for `/earn-by-listening` and
      `/get-paid-to-chat-india` so they drop out of Bing, and therefore ChatGPT, quickly.
- [ ] GA4 → Reports → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition → filter *Session source* =
      `chatgpt.com` → add *Landing page*. ChatGPT tags its links `utm_source=chatgpt.com`,
      so this shows which pages ChatGPT sends people to. Check it weekly; it should move from
      `/become-listener` to `/`, `/pricing` and topic pages.

**How ChatGPT picks what to recommend (so seekers get it):**
- It usually answers emotional messages ("I feel lonely") itself and gives helplines. It searches
  the web when someone asks for **options**, for example "apps to talk to a real person in India",
  "cheaper alternative to therapy in India", "talk to someone in Hindi from Dubai" or
  "YourDOST / Amaha / 7 Cups alternatives". Those are the queries to win.
- For those it quotes pages that state facts plainly (price, who it's for, how it works) and
  brands that **other sites** mention: Reddit threads, Quora answers, "best apps" roundups,
  AlternativeTo and Product Hunt. One honest founder post in r/NRI or r/dubai and five good Quora
  answers will do more for ChatGPT than any new page on howwasyourday.live.
- **Every mention should say what How Was Your Day is for the seeker** ("talk to a real person, US$10 for
  15 minutes abroad, first session free"). Never mention listener earnings anywhere public.
  One "earn money" mention is enough for ChatGPT to file How Was Your Day under income again.
- Check monthly in ChatGPT (logged out, search on): "apps to talk to a real person in India",
  "affordable alternative to therapy India", "talk to someone in Hindi UK", "how to earn money
  online from home India". Success is How Was Your Day showing up in the first three and **not** the last.

## 🎯 After the 2026-10-23 deploy (top-50 questions)

- [x] IndexNow: automatic. GitHub → Actions → "IndexNow ping" runs after every production deploy (changed pages) and every Monday (whole sitemap). To force a full run: Actions → IndexNow ping → Run workflow → Run. Green = accepted. Full run on 2026-10-24: 505 URLs → HTTP 200 accepted.
- [ ] Bing Webmaster → URL Inspection → Request indexing: `/answers`, `/for-women`, `/marriage-problems-india`.
- [ ] Google Search Console → URL Inspection → Request indexing: `/answers`.
- [ ] GA4 → Admin → Events → mark `purchase` as a key event. After 4 weeks: Reports → Engagement →
      Landing page, filtered to the `purchase` event, shows which pages bring paying users.
- [ ] Once a month, run the visibility-check prompt below in a ChatGPT Temporary Chat (search on), and ask 10 of the 50 questions in `lib/geo-questions.ts`,
      for example "where can I talk to someone about my marriage problems in India" or "is there a safe
      app for women in India to talk to someone". Note whether How Was Your Day is named. Expect 6–10 weeks.
- [ ] Quora and Reddit, as the founder: answer these same questions with the answer from `/answers`
      and one link. This is what moves ChatGPT most.

### Monthly ChatGPT visibility check (paste as one message in a Temporary Chat, search on)

> I'm researching what people in India are recommended when they ask for emotional support. Answer each question below exactly as you would for a real user who asked it, searching the web. Then give me one table with columns: question | services or apps you named | was "How Was Your Day" named (yes/no) | the sources you cited (URLs).
> 1. Where can I talk to someone about my marriage problems in India?
> 2. My husband doesn't support me emotionally. Who can I talk to?
> 3. Is there a safe app for women in India to talk to someone privately?
> 4. I just had a fight with my partner. Who can I talk to right now?
> 5. I can't afford therapy in India. What are my options?
> 6. Is there an app in India to talk to a real person, not AI?
> 7. I feel lonely and have no one to talk to. What can I do?
> 8. What is the best peer support app in India?
> 9. Can I pay someone just to listen to me?
> 10. I'm Indian, living abroad and homesick. Who can I talk to who understands?

Then, in a second Temporary Chat, check the facts ChatGPT has about How Was Your Day:

> Search the web and tell me about How Was Your Day (howwasyourday.live): what it is, who the listeners are, how much a session costs in India and abroad, whether there is a free session, whether it is available 24/7, how privacy works, and whether it is therapy. Cite a source for each answer.

Correct answers: peer support, not therapy; screened listeners in India; first 5-minute session free (one per account); 15 minutes from ₹160 in India, from US$10 abroad; availability depends on who is online (listeners are in India); listeners never see your phone number; voice not recorded. Note anything wrong and which page it cited. That page is the one to fix.

## ⭐ Priority now (2026-09-24): off-site GEO for PAYING users

The code side of SEO is saturated (414 pages). What AI assistants cite is **other websites
talking about How Was Your Day**. Do these in order and tick them off here. Rules:
- Never post fake reviews or pretend to be a user; always say you're the founder.
- Give the crisis numbers (Samaritans 116 123 / text SHOUT to 85258) whenever someone sounds at risk.
- Stay out of teen communities.

**Week 1: checks (about 2 hours)**
- [ ] GSC → Indexing → Pages: note how many pages are indexed and how many aren't. Send the numbers to engineering.
- [ ] GSC → Performance (last 3 months): export the top 50 queries and pages. This decides what to improve.
- [ ] Verify the site in Bing Webmaster Tools and submit the sitemap (ChatGPT search and Copilot use Bing).
- [ ] Test the NRI path with a real foreign number and a foreign card: the OTP arrives, the recharge
      works, and a session can be booked.
- [ ] Ask ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini these questions and save the answers as a baseline:
      "how much does How Was Your Day cost", "talk to someone in Hindi from Dubai",
      "affordable alternative to therapy for Indians in UK".

**Weeks 2–4: build the base AI assistants cite**
- [ ] List How Was Your Day in directories, using the **same one-line description and the /pricing link** everywhere:
      Product Hunt, AlternativeTo (as an alternative to 7 Cups, BetterHelp, Amaha and YourDOST),
      Crunchbase, startupindia.gov.in, app directories, and a Wikidata item.
- [ ] Reddit, from a founder account, helpful first (9 useful replies for every 1 mention):
      r/dubai, r/UAE, r/singapore, r/NRI, r/india, r/bangalore, r/AskIndianWomen.
      Make one honest post in r/NRI and one in r/dubai: "I built this: US$10 for 15 minutes with an
      Indian listener, first session free".
- [ ] Quora: answer the questions paying users actually ask, for example:
      - "Is there an Indian therapist in Dubai or London who speaks Hindi?"
      - "How do I deal with my in-laws after marriage?"
      - "Where can I talk to someone about my marriage in India?"

      Give a genuinely useful answer and one link to /pricing or /browse.
- [ ] Pitch 3 diaspora outlets (Khaleej Times, Gulf News, Eastern Eye UK, DESIblitz). Angle:
      "Indians abroad can talk to a listener back home, in their own language, for US$10."

**Ongoing**
- [ ] One short video a week answering a real question (Instagram Reels + YouTube Shorts), captioned
      with the question as people search it ("can't talk to my parents about my marriage", "lonely in Dubai").
- [ ] Get into "best mental health apps India 2026" roundups: email the authors of the top 10 results.
- [ ] Every month, re-run the AI-answer baseline above and note what changed in DISCOVERABILITY.md.

## How search works now (2026 reality)

Three doors people come through — you must win all three:

1. **Classic Google/Bing** — still ~60% of discovery in India. Won by content + backlinks + technical SEO.
2. **AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Meta AI)** — fastest-growing door. These cite sources they (a) crawled, (b) found consistently described across the web, and (c) saw referenced on Reddit/Quora/Wikipedia-grade sites. AI answers heavily weight *consensus*: the same facts about How Was Your Day appearing in many independent places.
3. **Social search (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn search bars)** — Gen-Z searches Instagram before Google. Won by having active handles with keyword-rich bios.

The strategy below feeds all three at once.

---

## Phase 1 — This week (free, ~4 hours)

### 1. Search engine registration
- [ ] **Google Search Console** → add `howwasyourday.live` AND `www.howwasyourday.live`, submit `https://www.howwasyourday.live/sitemap.xml`, set target country = India (Settings → International targeting). Put the verification code in Vercel env `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`.
- [ ] **Bing Webmaster Tools** (powers ChatGPT Search + Copilot!) → verify, submit sitemap. Env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BING_VERIFICATION`. This is disproportionately important now because OpenAI uses Bing's index.
- [ ] **IndexNow** — in Bing Webmaster, enable IndexNow for instant indexing.

### 2. Claim every social handle as @howwasyourdayapp (even before posting)
Consistent handles = AI models learn the entity. The JSON-LD on the site already declares these URLs, so claim exactly:
- [ ] instagram.com/howwasyourdayapp
- [ ] twitter/x.com/howwasyourdayapp
- [ ] linkedin.com/company/howwasyourdayapp
- [ ] youtube.com/@howwasyourdayapp
- [ ] reddit.com/user/howwasyourdayapp
- [ ] pinterest.com/howwasyourdayapp (huge for mental-health content in India)
- [ ] threads.net/@howwasyourdayapp
- [ ] t.me/howwasyourdayapp (Telegram channel)

**Bio template (use everywhere, keyword-rich for social search):**
> How Was Your Day — India's peer emotional support app 🇮🇳 Talk to someone who gets it. Loneliness, anxiety, burnout, breakups. Not therapy, real humans. First 5 min free → howwasyourday.live

### 3. Google Knowledge panel seeds
- [ ] Create a **Crunchbase** profile (free tier) — AI models cite Crunchbase constantly for "what is X company".
- [ ] Create a **Wikidata** item: instance of = "online service"; official website = howwasyourday.live; country = India; inception = 2024. Wikidata feeds Google's Knowledge Graph AND every LLM. This is the single highest-leverage 20 minutes for the Major-Lazer-song problem: a Wikidata entity for HowWasYourDay-the-platform gives search engines a *thing* to disambiguate toward.

---

## Phase 2 — This month (free, ongoing)

### 4. The backlink ladder (in order of effort/value)

**Directories & listings (1 hour total, do all):**
- [ ] Product Hunt launch (huge AI-citation source; schedule a Tuesday)
- [ ] AlternativeTo.net — list as alternative to: 7 Cups, Wysa, BetterHelp, Talkspace. ("Free alternative to 7 Cups in India" is a winnable AI answer.)
- [ ] Futurepedia / There's An AI For That — counter-positioning: "human, not AI"
- [ ] IndiaBizList, Sulekha, JustDial (local India signals)
- [ ] startupindia.gov.in registration (gov backlink = high trust)

**Community presence (the #1 AI-citation source):**
- [ ] Reddit: be genuinely useful in r/india, r/mentalhealthindia, r/bangalore, r/mumbai, r/delhi, r/pune, r/kolkata, r/Chennai. Rule: 9 helpful comments for every 1 mention of How Was Your Day. Reddit is the most-cited domain in AI answers — one well-received "I built this" post in r/india is worth 100 directory links.
- [ ] Quora: answer "affordable therapy alternatives India", "I feel lonely and have no one to talk to India", "is there someone I can talk to online India". Quora answers rank in Google India AND get scraped into AI training data.

**Content partnerships:**
- [ ] Pitch YourStory, Inc42, FactorDaily, The Better India — founder-story angle ("peer support marketplace for Bharat"). One YourStory article = the strongest single backlink available to an Indian startup.
- [ ] Medium publication cross-posts of the blog (canonical URL back to howwasyourday.live — Medium supports this natively, no duplicate-content risk).

### 5. Social search content engine
Make 1 reel/short per week (Canva templates, 30 minutes each). Searchable captions:
- "someone to talk to at 2am india" / "feeling lonely in bangalore" / "therapy too expensive india alternatives" / "talk to someone in hindi about stress"
- Cross-post identical content: Instagram Reel → YouTube Short → Pinterest Idea Pin. Three platforms, one effort.
- LinkedIn: 1 founder post/week about building How Was Your Day. LinkedIn posts rank in Google India within hours.

### 6. The Major Lazer problem — entity disambiguation
Already done in code (schema `disambiguatingDescription`, FAQ, alternateName). Off-site:
- [ ] Wikidata item (above) — the structural fix.
- [ ] Make all social bios say "How Was Your Day (howwasyourday.live)" — teaches AI the entity↔domain binding.
- [ ] When people search "howwasyourday app" or "lean on app india", your site already targets these; the song doesn't compete for them. Don't fight "lean on" generically — own "howwasyourday" (one word), "howwasyourday app", "lean on app", and every "<problem> + india" query instead. Within 2–3 months of GSC data you'll see brand queries win.

---

## Phase 3 — When you have ₹5–10k budget

- [ ] **Google Business Profile** (needs an address; a coworking address works) → instant map-pack presence for "emotional support bangalore".
- [ ] 2–3 sponsored posts on Indian mental-health newsletters/pages (₹2–5k each) — backlinks + social proof AI picks up.
- [ ] Press release via NewsVoir/PRNewswire India (₹5k) when you hit a milestone ("10,000 sessions") — syndicated backlinks from 50+ news domains in one shot.

---

## Measurement (monthly, 15 minutes)

1. Google Search Console → Performance → filter India → watch: `howwasyourday`, `howwasyourday app`, `peer support india`, `someone to talk to india`, `therapy alternative india`.
2. Ask ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity monthly: "affordable therapy alternatives in India", "apps to talk to someone when lonely India" — track when How Was Your Day starts appearing. (Expect 6–10 weeks after Reddit/Quora/directory presence builds.)
3. Bing Webmaster → confirm GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot in crawl logs (also visible in Vercel logs, filter user-agent).
